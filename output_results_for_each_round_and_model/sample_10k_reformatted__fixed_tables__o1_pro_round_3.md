ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

  

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities.

  

•The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission,
distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi,
Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a
small natural gas distribution business.

•The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership,
operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern
United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating
plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides
services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear
power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to
wholesale customers. See “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant
Power Business” below for discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and
sale of each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.

  

Following are the percentages of Entergy’s consolidated revenues generated by
its operating segments and the percentage of total assets held by them. Net
income or loss generated by the operating segments is discussed in the
sections that follow.

The COVID-19 Pandemic

  

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to control it have adversely affected
economic activity and conditions worldwide and have affected the demand for
the products and services of many businesses in Entergy’s service area.
Entergy experienced a decline in sales volume in 2020 compared to 2019 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the commercial and industrial sectors. In
addition, Entergy experienced negative changes to its customers’ payment
patterns and its operating cash flow activity in 2020 compared to 2019 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative changes include an increase in
uncollectible accounts.

  

Entergy provides critical services to its customers and has implemented its
comprehensive incident response plan, which contemplates major events such as
storms or pandemics. Entergy’s focus during the COVID-19 pandemic has been on
the safety and wellness of its employees; providing safe, reliable service for
its customers; analyzing and addressing the financial effects of the COVID-19
pandemic; and continuing its plans for the future. Entergy implemented
precautionary measures for safety on and off the job for employees and
contractors working at plants and in the field and implemented telecommuting
practices for employees who can work from home. Entergy temporarily suspended
service disconnections for customers and is working with regulators to address
routine and non-routine matters and allow continuation of capital spending
plans. The Utility operating companies have received accounting orders to
defer costs associated with COVID-19. To date, Entergy has not had material
effects to its major projects or capital spending plans. Entergy is working
with suppliers and contractors for continued availability of resources,
equipment, and supplies to keep operations and major projects going forward
and on schedule. Entergy implemented expense-related spending reductions in
2020, which did not affect safety or service reliability, in order to offset
some of the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Although Entergy has taken these actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
uncertainty exists regarding the full depth and length of the effects of
COVID-19 on Entergy’s sales volume, revenue, collections and cash flows,
expenses, liquidity, and capital needs. Entergy will continue to monitor
actively the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments affecting its
workforce, customers, suppliers, operations, and financial condition.

  

Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta

  

In August and October 2020, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta caused significant damage to portions of the Utility’s service
territories in Louisiana, including New Orleans, Texas, and to a lesser
extent, in Arkansas and Mississippi. The storms resulted in widespread power
outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure,
and the loss of sales during the outages. Additionally, as a result of
Hurricane Laura’s extensive damage to the grid infrastructure serving the
impacted area, large portions of the underlying transmission system required
nearly a complete rebuild. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or
replacement of the electrical system damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane
Delta, and Hurricane Zeta are currently estimated to be approximately $2.4
billion, including approximately $1.98 billion in capital costs and
approximately $420 million in non-capital costs. The majority of the costs
were incurred by Entergy Louisiana, with a substantial portion also incurred
by Entergy Texas. The estimate includes all costs to restore power and repair
or replace the damages from the hurricanes, except for the cost to repair or
replace damage incurred to an Entergy Louisiana transmission line in southeast
Louisiana, and the amount of that cost could be significant. The restoration
plan for this transmission line and the related cost estimate is still being
evaluated. Also, Utility revenues were adversely affected in 2020, primarily
due to power outages resulting from the hurricanes.

  

Entergy recorded accounts payable and corresponding construction work in
progress and regulatory assets for the estimated costs incurred that were
necessary to return customers to service. Entergy recorded the regulatory
assets in accordance with its accounting policies and based on the historic
treatment of such costs in its service area because management believes that
recovery through some form of regulatory mechanism is probable. There are
well-established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these catastrophic
events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in
accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because Entergy
has not gone through the regulatory process regarding these storm costs, there
is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to predict with certainty the
degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives, the amount of
restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing of such
recovery.

  

The Utility operating companies are considering all available avenues to
recover storm-related costs from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and
Hurricane Zeta, including accessing funded storm reserve escrows and
securitization. In November 2020, Entergy Louisiana drew $257 million from its
funded storm reserves. Each Utility operating company is responsible for its
restoration cost obligations and for recovering or financing its storm-related
costs. Storm cost recovery or financing will be subject to review by
applicable regulatory authorities.

  

In October 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC seeking
approval of certain ratemaking adjustments to facilitate issuance of shorter-
term bonds to provide interim financing for restoration costs associated with
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta. Subsequently, Entergy
Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed a joint motion seeking approval to exclude
from the derivation of Entergy Louisiana’s capital structure and cost rate of
debt for ratemaking purposes, including the allowance for funds used during
construction, shorter-term debt up to $1.1 billion issued by Entergy Louisiana
to fund costs associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta on an interim basis. In November 2020 the LPSC issued an order approving
the joint motion, and Entergy Louisiana issued $1.1 billion of 0.62% Series
mortgage bonds due November 2023.

  

In December 2020, Entergy Louisiana provided the LPSC with notification that
it intends to initiate a storm cost recovery proceeding in the near future,
which will permit the LPSC to retain any outside consultants and counsel
needed to review the storm cost recovery application. In February 2021 the
LPSC voted to retain outside

counsel and consultants to assist in the review of Entergy Louisiana’s
upcoming storm cost recovery application, which is expected to be filed in
March 2021.

  

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

In February 2021, the United States experienced winter storms and extreme cold
temperatures, including in Entergy’s service area. The impact of the storms
and the extreme cold temperatures affected Entergy’s operational assets and
the availability of generation across the area. In order to balance the
system, MISO directed Entergy to conduct rolling power outages. Entergy’s
system is now back to normal operations. The severe weather event also
affected the market for natural gas due to the severe cold’s effects on the
gas supply system and increased demand for gas to support electricity loads.
Entergy’s preliminary estimate for the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring
power is approximately $125 million to $140 million, primarily at Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi. Natural gas purchases for February 1st
through 25th, 2021, for Entergy were approximately $510 million, including
$105 million for Entergy Arkansas, $190 million for Entergy Louisiana, $45
million for Entergy Mississippi, $15 million for Entergy New Orleans, and $155
million for Entergy Texas. This compares to natural gas purchases for February
2020 for Entergy of $80 million, including $10 million for Entergy Arkansas,
$39 million for Entergy Louisiana, $14 million for Entergy Mississippi, $7
million for Entergy New Orleans, and $10 million for Entergy Texas.

  

The Utility operating companies each have fuel recovery mechanisms in place to
recover their natural gas costs. With the potential effect of the higher
natural gas costs on customers, the Utility operating companies plan to work
with their retail regulators to recover these costs in a manner that mitigates
the effects on customer bills. The Utility operating companies also expect to
work with their regulators as the regulators review other effects of the
winter storm.

Operating Revenues

  

Utility

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2020 to
2019:

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $9,584 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income |  |  |  |  | |
|(792) |  |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | (164) |  |  |  | |
|System Energy provision for rate refund | (25) |  |  |  | |
|Return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers | 194 |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | 374 |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | $9,171 |  |  |  | |
  
  

The Utility operating companies’ results include revenues from rate mechanisms
designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the
revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not
affect net income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly
affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to decreased commercial and
industrial usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta, in addition to the
effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales,
partially offset by an increase in residential usage as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in industrial usage is partially offset by an
increase in demand from expansion projects, primarily in the transportation
and chemicals industries. See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” above for discussion of
the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta” above for discussion of the storms.

  

The System Energy provision for rate refund variance is due to a provision for
rate refund recorded in 2020 to reflect a one-time credit of $25 million
provided for in the Federal Power Act section 205 filing made by System Energy
in December 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further
discussion of the proceedings involving System Energy at the FERC.

  

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to
customers resulted from activity at the Utility operating companies in
response to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The return of
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes began in second quarter
2018. In 2020, $68 million was returned to customers through reductions in
operating revenues as compared to $262 million in 2019. There is no effect on
net income as the reductions in operating revenues were offset by reductions
in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further
discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to:

  

•interim increases in Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan revenues effective
June 2019 due to the inclusion of the first-year revenue requirement for the
J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station) and
effective April 2020 due to the inclusion of the first-year revenue
requirement for the Lake Charles Power Station and increases in formula rate
plan revenues effective September 2019 and September 2020;

•increases in Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan rates effective with the
first billing cycles of July 2019 and April 2020 and an interim capacity rate
adjustment to the formula rate plan effective January 2020 to recover non-fuel
related costs of acquiring and operating the Choctaw Generating Station;

•an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan rates effective with the
first billing cycle of January 2020;

•the implementation of a vegetation management rider at Entergy Mississippi
effective with the April 2020 billing cycle; and

•increases in Entergy Texas’s transmission cost recovery factor rider
effective January 2020 and distribution cost recovery factor rider effective
October 2020.

  

The increase was partially offset by the effects of Entergy New Orleans’s rate
reduction implemented with April 2020 bills that was effective August 2019 in
accordance with the City Council resolution and related agreement in principle
reached in the 2018 base rate case.

  

See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the
regulatory proceedings discussed above.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

  

Operating revenues for Entergy Wholesale Commodities decreased from $1,295
million for 2019 to $943 million for 2020 primarily due to the shutdown of
Indian Point 2 in April 2020 and the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019.

  

Following are key performance measures for Entergy Wholesale Commodities for
2020 and 2019:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|2020 |  | 2019 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Owned capacity (MW) (a) | 2,246 |  | 3,274 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

|Palisades | 52 |  | — |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

(a)The reduction in owned capacity is due to the shutdown of the 1,028 MW
Indian Point 2 plant in April 2020.

Other Income Statement Items

  

Utility

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $2,563 million for
2019 to $2,478 million for 2020 primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $42 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to
lower nuclear labor costs, including contract labor, and a lower scope of work
performed in 2020 as compared to 2019, in part as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic;

•a decrease of $25 million primarily due to contract costs in 2019 related to
initiatives to explore new customer products and services;

•a decrease of $20 million in non-nuclear generation expenses due to a lower
scope of work performed during plant outages in 2020 as compared to prior
year, including a delay in plant outages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and lower long-term service agreement expenses, partially offset by higher
expenses associated with plants placed in service, including the J. Wayne
Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station), which began
commercial operation in May 2019, the Choctaw Generating Station, which was
purchased in October 2019, and the Lake Charles Power Station, which began
commercial operation in March 2020;

•higher nuclear insurance refunds of $18 million; and

•an $11 million write-off in 2019 of specific costs related to the potential
construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant at Entergy Arkansas. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the write-off.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•an increase of $10 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due
to an increase in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs
as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit
liabilities, partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation accruals
in 2020 as compared to prior year. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below
and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and
other postretirement benefit costs;

•an increase of $5 million primarily due to the 2019 deferral by Entergy New
Orleans of costs related to its 2018 rate case and a system conversion for
Algiers customers as a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution
approved by the City Council. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the rate case resolution; and

•several individually insignificant items.

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to
plant in service, including the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St.
Charles Power Station), the Lake Charles Power Station, and the Choctaw
Generating Station, and new depreciation rates at Entergy Mississippi, as
approved by the MPSC.

  

Other regulatory charges (credits) - net for 2020 included a provision of
$43.5 million to reflect the 2019 historical year netting adjustment included
in the APSC’s December 2020 order in Entergy Arkansas’s 2020 formula rate plan
proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy
Arkansas’s 2020 formula rate plan proceedings.

  

Other income decreased primarily due to:

  

•a decrease in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to
higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the J. Wayne Leonard
Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station) project and the Lake
Charles Power Station project, partially offset by construction work in
progress in 2020 related to the Montgomery County Power Station project; and

•an increase in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits non-
service pension costs as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to
value the benefits liabilities. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and
Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and
other postretirement benefit costs.

  

The decrease was partially offset by changes in decommissioning trust fund
activity.

  

Interest expense increased primarily due to:

  

•the issuances by Entergy Texas of $300 million in September 2019 and $175
million in March 2020 of 3.55% Series mortgage bonds;

•the issuances by Entergy Louisiana of $300 million of 4.20% Series mortgage
bonds and $350 million of 2.90% Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2020, and
$525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;

•the issuances by Entergy Arkansas of $350 million of 4.20% Series mortgage
bonds in March 2019 and $100 million of 4.0% Series mortgage bonds in March
2020; and

•the issuances by Entergy Mississippi of $135 million of 3.85% Series mortgage
bonds in November 2019 and $170 million of 3.50% Series mortgage bonds in May
2020.

  

See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term debt.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $678 million for 2019
to $500 million for 2020 primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $154 million resulting from the absence of expenses from the
Pilgrim plant after it was shut down in May 2019 and the Indian Point 2 plant
after it was shut down in April 2020; and

•a decrease of $23 million in severance and retention expenses. Severance and
retention expenses were incurred in 2020 and 2019 due to management’s strategy
to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.

  

See “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business”
below for a discussion of management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of
the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of severance
and retention expenses resulting from management’s strategy to shut down and
sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant
nuclear fleet. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion
of the sale of the Pilgrim plant.

  

Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges for 2020 include impairment
charges of $19 million ($15 million net-of-tax) primarily as a result of
expenditures for capital assets. Asset write-offs, impairments, and related
charges for 2019 include a loss of $190 million ($156 million net-of-tax) as a
result of the sale of the Pilgrim plant in August 2019 and impairment charges
of $100 million ($79 million net-of-tax) primarily related to nuclear
refueling outage spending and expenditures for capital assets. These costs
were charged to expense as incurred as a result of the impaired fair value of
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the
significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with
management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power
business. See “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power
Business” below for a discussion of management’s strategy to shut down and
sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant
nuclear fleet. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
impairment of long-lived assets and the sale of the Pilgrim plant.

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to the absence
of depreciation expense from the Indian Point 2 plant, after it was shut down
in April 2020.

  

Other income decreased primarily due to lower gains on decommissioning trust
fund investments and a decrease in intercompany interest income resulting from
repayment in second quarter 2020 of an intercompany loan to Entergy
Corporation. See Notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements for a discussion
of decommissioning trust fund investments.

  

Other expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of decommissioning
expense from the Pilgrim plant, after it was sold in August 2019. See Note 14
to the financial statements for a discussion of the sale of the Pilgrim plant.

  

Parent and Other

  

Other income increased primarily due to the absence of the elimination of
other income at Entergy Wholesale Commodities after repayment of an
intercompany loan in second quarter 2020 and a $15 million charitable donation
made in 2019 to fund the Entergy Charitable Foundation for three years.

  

Income Taxes

  

See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal
statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional
discussion regarding income taxes.

  

The effective income tax rate for 2020 was (9.5%). The difference in the
effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 21% was
primarily due to completion of the 2014-2015 IRS audit effectively settling
the tax positions for those years. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
a discussion of the 2014-2015 IRS audit.

  

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was (15.6%). The difference in the
effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 21% was
primarily due to amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes,
recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with a previously unrecognized
net operating loss carryover, a charitable tax deduction, and the effects of
restructuring transactions within Entergy Wholesale Commodities, partially
offset by valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets associated
with the disposition of Vermont Yankee and the carryover of business interest
expense. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note
3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the internal restructuring
at Entergy Wholesale Commodities. See Note 14 to the financial statements for
a discussion of the tax effects of the Vermont Yankee disposition.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

  

Entergy sold its FitzPatrick plant to Exelon in March 2017 and, as discussed
below, transferred its Vermont Yankee plant to NorthStar in January 2019 and
sold its Pilgrim plant to Holtec in August 2019. The Palisades and Indian
Point plants are under contract to be sold, subject to certain conditions,
after they are shut down. Entergy also sold the Rhode Island State Energy
Center, a natural gas-fired combined cycle generating plant, in December 2015.

  

These plant sales and contracts to sell are the result of a strategy that
Entergy has undertaken to manage and reduce the risk of the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business, including exiting the merchant power business.
Management evaluated the challenges for each of the plants based on a variety
of factors such as their market for both energy and capacity, their size,
their contracted positions, and the amount of investment required to continue
to operate and maintain the safety and integrity of the plants, including the
estimated asset retirement costs. Changes to current assumptions regarding the
remaining operating life of a plant, the decommissioning timeline and process,
or the length of time that Entergy will continue to own a plant could result
in revisions to the asset retirement obligations and affect compliance with
certain NRC minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations
to decommission the plants. Increases in the asset retirement obligations are
likely to result in an increase in operating expense in the period of a
revision. The possibility that a plant may have an operating life shorter than
previously assumed could result in the need for additional contributions to
decommissioning trust funds, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of
credit, or other surety mechanisms.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating
nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York,
that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2
nuclear plants, respectively. Big Rock Point is under contract to be sold with
the Palisades plant and Indian Point 1 is under contract to be sold with the
Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants. In addition, Entergy Wholesale
Commodities provides operations and management services, including
decommissioning-related services, to nuclear power plants owned by non-
affiliated entities in the United States. A relatively minor portion of the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is the ownership of interests in non-
nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to
wholesale customers.

  

Shutdown and Disposition of Vermont Yankee

  

On December 29, 2014, the Vermont Yankee plant ceased power production and
entered its decommissioning phase. In November 2016, Entergy entered into an
agreement to transfer 100% of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear
Vermont Yankee, LLC to a subsidiary of NorthStar. Entergy Nuclear Vermont
Yankee was the owner of the Vermont Yankee plant. The transaction included the
transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the asset retirement
obligation for the spent fuel management and decommissioning of the plant.

  

In March 2018, Entergy and NorthStar entered into a settlement agreement and a
Memorandum of Understanding with State of Vermont agencies and other
interested parties that set forth the terms on which the agencies and parties
supported the Vermont Public Utility Commission’s approval of the transaction.
The agreements provided additional financial assurance for decommissioning,
spent fuel management and site restoration, and detailed the site restoration
standards. In October 2018 the NRC issued an order approving the application
to transfer Vermont Yankee’s license to NorthStar for decommissioning. In
December 2018 the Vermont Public Utility Commission issued an order approving
the transaction consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding’s terms. On
January 11, 2019, Entergy and NorthStar closed the transaction.

  

Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee had an outstanding credit facility that was
used to pay for dry fuel storage costs. This credit facility was guaranteed by
Entergy Corporation. A subsidiary of Entergy assumed the obligations under the
credit facility, and it remains outstanding. At the closing of the sale
transaction, NorthStar caused Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, renamed
NorthStar Vermont Yankee, to issue a $139 million promissory note to the
Entergy subsidiary that assumed the credit facility obligations. The amount of
the note includes the

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

balance outstanding on the credit facility, as well as borrowing fees and
costs incurred by Entergy in connection with the credit facility.

  

With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont Public Utility Commission approvals
and the resolution among the parties of the significant conditions of the
sale, Entergy concluded that as of December 31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in
held for sale status. Entergy accordingly evaluated Vermont Yankee’s asset
retirement obligation in light of the terms of the transaction and evaluated
the remaining values of the Vermont Yankee assets. These evaluations resulted
in an increase in the asset retirement obligation and $173 million of related
asset impairment and other charges in the fourth quarter 2018. See Note 9 to
the financial statements for additional discussion of the asset retirement
obligation. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the
closing of the Vermont Yankee transaction.

  

Shutdown and Sale of Pilgrim

  

In October 2015, Entergy determined that it would close the Pilgrim plant, and
Pilgrim ceased operations in May 2019. See Note 14 to the financial statements
for discussion of the impairment charges associated with the decision to cease
operations earlier than expected.

  

On July 30, 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with
Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary 100% of the equity
interests in Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, LLC, the owner of Pilgrim,
for $1,000 (subject to adjustments for net liabilities and other amounts). On
August 22, 2019, the NRC approved the transfer of Pilgrim’s facility licenses
to Holtec. At that time, hearing requests filed by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and Pilgrim Watch challenging Holtec’s financial qualifications
and the sufficiency of the NRC’s review of the associated environmental
impacts of the license transfer were pending with the NRC commissioners. The
NRC approval order included a condition acknowledging the NRC’s longstanding
authority to modify, condition, or rescind the license transfer order as a
result of any hearing that may be conducted. On August 26, 2019, as permitted
by the August 22 order, Entergy and Holtec closed the transaction.

  

On September 25, 2019, Massachusetts filed a petition with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the court to vacate the
NRC’s August 22 license transfer approval order and related approvals. On
November 22, 2019, Entergy and Holtec filed a motion to dismiss Massachusetts’
petition; the NRC also filed a motion to dismiss on the same date. On January
22, 2020, Massachusetts filed a second petition with the D.C. Circuit asking
the court to review the NRC’s December 17, 2019 order denying its stay motion.
On June 16, 2020, Holtec and Massachusetts reached a settlement to resolve
issues related to the Pilgrim transaction. Pursuant to the settlement
agreement, Massachusetts withdrew its hearing request pending before the NRC
and withdrew both of its petitions for review before the D.C. Circuit, thereby
terminating Massachusetts’s pending legal challenges to the Pilgrim transfer.
The NRC denied Pilgrim Watch’s hearing request in November 2020, and Pilgrim
Watch did not file a judicial appeal of the NRC’s denial order.

  

The sale of Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, LLC to Holtec included the
transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust and obligation for spent fuel
management and plant decommissioning. The transaction resulted in a loss of
$190 million ($156 million net-of-tax) in 2019. See Note 14 to the financial
statements for discussion of the closing of the Pilgrim transaction.

  

Planned Shutdown and Sale of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3

  

In April 2007, Entergy submitted to the NRC a joint application to renew the
operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 for an additional 20
years. In January 2017, Entergy reached a settlement with New York State,
several State agencies, and Riverkeeper, Inc., under which Indian Point 2 and
Indian Point 3 would cease commercial operation by April 30, 2020 and April
30, 2021, respectively, subject to certain conditions, including New York
State’s withdrawal of opposition to Indian Point’s license renewals and
issuance of contested permits and similar authorizations. Operations could be
extended up to four additional years for each unit by

mutual agreement of Entergy and New York State based on an exigent reliability
need for Indian Point generation. In September 2018 the NRC issued renewed
operating licenses for Indian Point 2 through April 2024 and for Indian Point
3 through April 2025. Pursuant to the January 2017 settlement agreement,
Indian Point 2 ceased commercial operations on April 30, 2020, and Indian
Point 3 is expected to cease commercial operations on April 30, 2021. See Note
14 to the financial statements for discussion of the impairment charges
associated with the decision to shut down the Indian Point plants.

  

Other provisions of the settlement include termination of all then-existing
investigations of Indian Point by the parties to the agreement, which include
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York
State Department of State, the New York State Department of Public Service,
the New York State Department of Health, and the New York State Attorney
General. The settlement recognizes the right of New York State agencies to
pursue new investigations and enforcement actions with respect to new
circumstances or existing conditions that become materially exacerbated.

  

Another provision of the settlement obligates Entergy to establish a $15
million fund for environmental projects and community support. Apportionment
and allocation of funds to beneficiaries are to be determined by mutual
agreement of New York State and Entergy. The settlement recognizes New York
State’s right to perform an annual inspection of Indian Point, with scope and
timing to be determined by mutual agreement.

  

In April 2019, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell, directly or
indirectly, 100% of the equity interests in the subsidiaries that own Indian
Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, after Indian Point 3 has been
shut down and defueled, to a Holtec subsidiary for decommissioning the plants.
The sale will include the transfer of the licenses, spent fuel,
decommissioning liabilities, and nuclear decommissioning trusts for the three
units.

  

The transaction is subject to closing conditions, including approval from the
NRC. In November 2019, Entergy and Holtec submitted a license transfer
application to the NRC. The NRC issued an order approving the application in
November 2020, subject to the NRC’s authority to condition, revise, or rescind
the approval order based on the resolution of four pending hearing requests. A
substantially identical condition was imposed in the NRC’s August 2019 order
approving the license transfer for Pilgrim. In January 2021 the NRC issued an
order denying all four hearing requests challenging the license transfer
application. In January 2021, New York State filed a petition for review with
the D.C. Circuit asking the court to vacate the NRC’s January 2021 order
denying the State’s hearing request, as well as the NRC’s November 2020 order
approving the license transfers. In January 2021 the D.C. Circuit issued a
scheduling order, setting deadlines for initial procedural filings in March
2021. Any other petitioners seeking judicial review of the January 2021 NRC
order must file their petitions by March 16, 2021.

  

Entergy and Holtec also submitted a petition to the New York State Public
Service Commission in November 2019 seeking an order from the New York Public
Service Commission disclaiming jurisdiction or abstaining from review of the
transaction or, alternatively, approving the transaction. Closing is also
conditioned on obtaining from the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation an agreement related to Holtec’s decommissioning plan as being
consistent with applicable standards. The transaction closing is targeted for
May 2021, following the defueling of Indian Point 3.

  

As consideration for the transfer to Holtec of its interest in Indian Point,
Entergy will receive nominal cash consideration. The Indian Point transaction
is expected to result in a loss based on the difference between Entergy’s
adjusted net investment in the subsidiaries at closing and the sale price net
of any agreed adjustments. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy’s adjusted net
investment in the Indian Point units was $255 million. The primary variables
in the ultimate loss that Entergy will incur are the values of the nuclear
decommissioning trusts and the asset retirement obligations at closing, the
financial results from plant operations until the closing, and the level of
any unrealized deferred tax balances at closing. The terms of the transaction
include limitations on withdrawals from the nuclear decommissioning trusts to
fund decommissioning activities and controls on how Entergy manages the
investment of nuclear decommissioning trust assets between signing and
closing; however, the agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in
the nuclear decommissioning trusts as a condition to closing.

Planned Shutdown and Sale of Palisades

  

Almost all of the Palisades output is sold under a power purchase agreement
with Consumers Energy, entered into when the plant was acquired in 2007, that
is scheduled to expire in 2022. The PPA prices currently exceed market prices.
In December 2016, Entergy reached an agreement with Consumers Energy to amend
the existing PPA to terminate early, on May 31, 2018. Pursuant to the
agreement to amend the PPA, Consumers Energy would pay Entergy $172 million
for the early termination of the PPA. The PPA amendment agreement was subject
to regulatory approvals, including approval by the Michigan Public Service
Commission. Separately, Entergy intended to shut down the Palisades nuclear
power plant permanently on October 1, 2018, after refueling in the spring of
2017 and operating through the end of that fuel cycle.

  

In September 2017 the Michigan Public Service Commission issued an order
conditionally approving the PPA amendment transaction, but only granting
Consumers Energy recovery of $136.6 million of the $172 million requested
early termination payment. As a result, Entergy and Consumers Energy agreed to
terminate the PPA amendment agreement. Entergy continues to operate Palisades
under the existing PPA with Consumers Energy, instead of shutting down in the
fall of 2018 as previously planned. Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades
nuclear power plant permanently no later than May 31, 2022. As a result of the
increase in the expected operating life of the plant, the expected
probability-weighted undiscounted net cash flows as of September 30, 2017
exceeded the carrying value of the plant and related assets. Accordingly,
nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, and expenditures for
capital assets incurred at Palisades after September 30, 2017 are no longer
charged to expense as incurred, but recorded as assets and depreciated or
amortized, subject to the typical periodic impairment reviews prescribed in
the accounting rules.

  

On July 30, 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with
Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary 100% of the equity
interests in the subsidiary that owns Palisades and the Big Rock Point Site.
The sale will include the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust and
obligation for spent fuel management and plant decommissioning. In February
2020 the parties signed an amendment to the purchase and sale agreement to
remove the closing condition that the nuclear decommissioning trust fund must
have a specified amount and Entergy agreed to contribute $20 million to the
nuclear decommissioning trust fund at closing, among other amendments. At the
closing of the sale transaction, the Holtec subsidiary will pay $1,000
(subject to adjustment for net liabilities and other amounts) for the equity
interests in the subsidiary that owns Palisades and the Big Rock Point Site.

  

The Palisades transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including:
the permanent shutdown of Palisades and the transfer of all nuclear fuel from
the reactor vessel to the spent nuclear fuel pool; NRC regulatory approval for
the transfer of the Palisades and Big Rock Point operating and independent
spent fuel storage installation licenses; receipt of a favorable private
letter ruling from the IRS; and, the Pilgrim transaction having closed. In
December 2020, Entergy and Holtec submitted a license transfer application to
the NRC requesting approval to transfer the Palisades and Big Rock Point
licenses from Entergy to Holtec. The NRC has indicated that it expects to
complete its review of the application by January 2022. In February 2021 the
Michigan Attorney General; the Environmental Law & Policy Center; and Beyond
Nuclear, Michigan Safe Energy Future, and Don’t Waste Michigan filed with the
NRC petitions to intervene and requests for hearing challenging the license
transfer application.

  

Subject to the above conditions, the Palisades transaction is expected to
close by the end of 2022. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy’s adjusted net
investment in Palisades was $75 million. The primary variables in the ultimate
loss or gain that Entergy will incur on the transaction are the values of the
nuclear decommissioning trust and the asset retirement obligations at closing,
the financial results from plant operations until the closing, and the level
of any unrealized deferred tax balances at closing. Palisades completed its
final refueling outage in October 2020.

Costs Associated with Exit of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities Business

  

Entergy incurred approximately $71 million in costs in 2020, $91 million in
costs in 2019, and $139 million in costs in 2018 associated with management’s
strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business,
primarily employee retention and severance expenses and other benefits-related
costs, and contracted economic development contributions. Entergy expects to
incur employee retention and severance expenses of approximately $40 million
in 2021 and $15 million in 2022 associated with the exit from the merchant
power business. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion
of these costs.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities incurred $19 million in 2020, $100 million in
2019, and $532 million in 2018 of impairment charges related to nuclear fuel
spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, expenditures for capital assets,
and asset retirement obligation revisions. These costs were charged to expense
as incurred as a result of the impaired value of certain of the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the
significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with
management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power
business. Entergy expects to continue to charge Indian Point Energy Center
capital asset costs to expense as incurred because Entergy expects its value
to continue to be impaired. See Note 14 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the impairment charges.

  

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  

This section discusses Entergy’s capital structure, capital spending plans and
other uses of capital, sources of capital, and the cash flow activity
presented in the cash flow statement.

  

Capital Structure

  

Entergy’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase
in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the net issuance of debt in
2020. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term
debt.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

|2020 |  | December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
2019  
Debt to capital | 68.3% |  | 65.5%
--- | --- | --- | ---
Effect of excluding securitization bonds | (0.2%) |  | (0.4%)
Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 68.1% |  | 65.1%
Effect of subtracting cash | (1.7%) |  | (0.5%)
Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 66.4% |  | 64.6%
  
  

(a)Calculation excludes the Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans, and Texas
securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas, respectively.

  

21.4% of the debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 is at the parent company,
Entergy Corporation, 78.0% is at the Utility, and 0.6% is at Entergy Wholesale
Commodities. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt
consists of notes payable and commercial paper, finance lease obligations, and
long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of
debt, common shareholders’ equity, and subsidiaries’ preferred stock without
sinking fund. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.
Entergy uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in
analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information
to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy’s financial condition
because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy, as more fully
described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy also uses the net
debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its
financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its
investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy’s financial condition because
net debt indicates Entergy’s outstanding debt position that could not be
readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

The Utility operating companies and System Energy seek to optimize their
capital structures in accordance with regulatory requirements and to control
their cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level
consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that their
operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to
reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend to their parent, or both,
in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that
their operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments,
the Utility operating companies and System Energy may issue incremental debt
or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain their capital structures. In
addition, Entergy may make equity contributions to the Utility operating
companies and System Energy to maintain their capital structures in certain
circumstances such as financing of large transactions or payments that would
materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and
reduced dividends.

  

Long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, makes up most of
Entergy’s total debt outstanding. Following are Entergy’s long-term debt
principal maturities and estimated interest payments as of December 31, 2020.
To estimate future interest payments for variable rate debt, Entergy used the
rate as of December 31, 2020. The amounts below include payments on System
Energy’s Grand Gulf sale-leaseback transaction, which are included in long-
term debt on the balance sheet.

Note 5 to the financial statements provides more detail concerning long-term
debt outstanding.

  

Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing
capacity of $3.5 billion and expires in September 2024. The facility includes
fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $20 million
of the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The commitment fee is
currently 0.225% of the undrawn commitment amount. Commitment fees and
interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on
the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The weighted average
interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.35% on the drawn
portion of the facility.

  

As of December 31, 2020, amounts outstanding and capacity available under the
$3.5 billion credit facility are:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

(In Millions)  
$3,500| | $165| | $6| | $3,329  
  
  

A covenant in Entergy Corporation’s credit facility requires Entergy to
maintain a consolidated debt ratio, as defined, of 65% or less of its total
capitalization. The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy Corporation’s
credit facility is different than the calculation of the debt to capital ratio
above. One such difference is that it excludes the effects, among other
things, of certain impairments related to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities
nuclear generation assets. Entergy is currently in compliance with the
covenant and expects to remain in compliance with this covenant. If Entergy
fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy or one of the Utility operating
companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the Entergy
Corporation credit facility’s maturity date may occur.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

In addition to the contractual obligations stated above, Entergy currently
expects to contribute approximately $356 million to its pension plans and
approximately $39.9 million to other postretirement plans in 2021, although
the 2021 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when
the January 1, 2021 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1,
2021. See “Critical Accounting Estimates \- Qualified Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits” below and Note 11 for a discussion of qualified
pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

  

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy has $979 million of
unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which
the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to
uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note
3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding
unrecognized tax benefits.

  

Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital

  

Following are the amounts of Entergy’s planned construction and other capital
investments by operating segment for 2021 through 2023.

|Total |  | $3,485 |  |  | $3,560 |  |  | $4,605 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

In addition to the planned spending in the table above, the Utility also
expects to pay for $1,055 million of capital investments in 2021 related to
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration work that
have been accrued as of December 31, 2020.

  

Planned construction and capital investments refer to amounts Entergy plans to
spend on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of
its service, equipment, or systems and to support normal customer growth. In
addition to routine capital projects, they also refer to amounts Entergy plans
to spend on non-routine capital investments for which Entergy is either
contractually obligated, has Board approval, or otherwise expects to make to
satisfy regulatory or legal requirements. Amounts include the following types
of construction and capital investments:

  

•Investments in renewables and other generation, including the Sunflower Solar
Facility, Searcy Solar Facility, Walnut Bend Solar Facility, West Memphis
Solar Facility, Liberty County Solar Facility, and Hardin County Peaking
Facility, and potential construction of additional generation.

•Investments in Entergy’s Utility nuclear fleet.

•Transmission spending to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable
economic growth.

•Distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to
customers, including investment to support advanced metering.

•Entergy Wholesale Commodities investments such as component replacements,
software and security, and dry cask storage.

  

For the next several years, the Utility’s owned generating capacity is
projected to be adequate to meet MISO reserve requirements; however, in the
longer-term additional supply resources will be needed, and its supply plan
initiative

18

will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new
generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative,
including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources,
could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates
given above. Estimated capital expenditures are also subject to periodic
review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of business
restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental
regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends,
changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

  

Renewables

  

Sunflower Solar Facility

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi announced that it signed an agreement
for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW solar photovoltaic facility that
will be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi.
The estimated base purchase price is approximately $138.4 million. The
estimated total investment, including the base purchase price and other
related costs, for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Sunflower Solar Facility
is approximately $153.2 million. The purchase is contingent upon, among other
things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from
applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. The project
is being built by Sunflower County Solar Project, LLC, an indirect subsidiary
of Recurrent Energy, LLC. Entergy Mississippi will purchase the facility upon
mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been
met. In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed a joint petition with
Sunflower Solar Project with the MPSC for Sunflower Solar Project to construct
and for Entergy Mississippi to acquire and thereafter own, operate, improve,
and maintain the solar facility. Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its
formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism, the interim capacity
rate adjustment mechanism, in the formula rate plan to recover the non-fuel
related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi,
including the annual ownership costs of the Sunflower Solar Facility. In
December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to
its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment
mechanism. Recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment requires MPSC
approval for each new resource. In August 2019 consultants retained by the
Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed a report expressing concerns
regarding the project economics. In March 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed
supplemental testimony addressing questions and observations raised by the
consultants retained by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and proposing
an alternative structure for the transaction that would reduce its cost. A
hearing before the MPSC was held in March 2020. In April 2020 the MPSC issued
an order approving certification of the Sunflower Solar Facility and its
recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, subject to
certain conditions including: (i) that Entergy Mississippi pursue a
partnership structure through which the partnership would acquire and own the
facility under the build-own-transfer agreement and (ii) that if Entergy
Mississippi does not consummate the partnership structure under the terms of
the order, there will be a cap of $136 million on the level of recoverable
costs. Closing is targeted to occur by the end of 2021.

  

Searcy Solar Facility

  

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an agreement for the
purchase of an approximately 100 MW solar energy facility that will be sited
on approximately 800 acres in White County near Searcy, Arkansas. The purchase
is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals from
applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. The project
is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. Entergy
Arkansas will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the
other purchase contingencies have been met. Closing is expected to occur by
the end of 2021. In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC
seeking a finding that the transaction is in the public interest and
requesting all necessary approvals. In September 2019 other parties filed
testimony largely supporting the resource acquisition but disputing Entergy
Arkansas’s proposed method of cost recovery. Entergy Arkansas filed its
rebuttal testimony in October 2019. In February 2020, Entergy Arkansas, the
Attorney General, and the APSC general staff filed a partial settlement
agreement asking the APSC to approve, based on the record in the proceeding,
all issues except certain issues that are submitted to the APSC for
determination. In April 2020 the APSC issued an order

19

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

approving Entergy Arkansas’s acquisition of the Searcy Solar facility as being
in the public interest, but declined to approve Entergy Arkansas’s preferred
cost recovery rider mechanism, finding instead, based on the particular facts
and circumstances presented, that the formula rate plan rider was a sufficient
recovery mechanism for this resource.

  

Liberty County Solar Facility

  

In September 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to
amend Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to acquire the
100 MW Liberty County Solar Facility and a determination that Entergy Texas’s
acquisition of the facility through a tax equity partnership is in the public
interest. In its preliminary order, the PUCT determined that, in considering
Entergy Texas’s application, it would not specifically address whether Entergy
Texas’s use of a tax equity partnership is in the public interest. A
procedural schedule was established with a hearing on the merits scheduled in
April 2021. Closing is expected to occur in 2023.

  

Walnut Bend Solar Facility

  

In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a
finding that the purchase of the 100 MW Walnut Bend Solar Facility is in the
public interest. Entergy Arkansas requested a decision by the APSC by June 15,
2021 and primarily requests cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider.
A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in April 2021.
Closing is expected to occur in 2022.

  

West Memphis Solar Facility

  

In January 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a
finding that the purchase of the 180 MW West Memphis Solar Facility is in the
public interest. Entergy Arkansas requested a decision by the APSC by
September 7, 2021 and primarily requests cost recovery through the formula
rate plan rider. Closing is expected to occur in 2023.

  

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

  

Declarations of dividends on Entergy’s common stock are made at the discretion
of the Board. Among other things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy’s
common stock dividends based upon earnings per share from the Utility
operating segment and the Parent and Other portion of the business, financial
strength, and future investment opportunities. At its January 2021 meeting,
the Board declared a dividend of $0.95 per share. Entergy paid $748 million in
2020, $712 million in 2019, and $648 million in 2018 in cash dividends on its
common stock.

  

In accordance with Entergy’s stock-based compensation plans, Entergy
periodically grants stock options, restricted stock, performance units, and
restricted stock unit awards to key employees, which may be exercised to
obtain shares of Entergy’s common stock. According to the plans, these shares
can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open
market. Entergy’s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on
the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of
grants under the plans.

  

In addition to the authority to fund grant exercises, the Board has authorized
share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in response to
market conditions. In October 2010 the Board granted authority for a $500
million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, $350 million of
authority remains under the $500 million share repurchase program. The amount
of repurchases may vary as a result of material changes in business results or
capital spending or new investment opportunities, or if limitations in the
credit markets continue for a prolonged period.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Sources of Capital

  

Entergy’s sources to meet its capital requirements and to fund potential
investments include:

  

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand ($1,759 million as of December 31, 2020);

•storm reserve escrow accounts;

•debt and equity issuances in the capital markets, including debt issuances to
refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;

•bank financing under new or existing facilities or commercial paper; and

•sales of assets.

  

Circumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price
fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages
and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in
the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital
requirements and contractual obligations, the Registrant Subsidiaries expect
to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and
replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.

  

Provisions within the organizational documents relating to preferred stock or
membership interests of certain of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries could
restrict the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on their common
and preferred equity. All debt and preferred equity issuances by the
Registrant Subsidiaries require prior regulatory approval and their debt
issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in bond indentures and
other agreements. Entergy believes that the Registrant Subsidiaries have
sufficient capacity under these tests to meet foreseeable capital needs.

  

The FERC has jurisdiction over securities issuances by the Utility operating
companies and System Energy. The City Council has concurrent jurisdiction over
Entergy New Orleans’s securities issuances with maturities longer than one
year. The APSC has concurrent jurisdiction over Entergy Arkansas’s issuances
of securities secured by Arkansas property, including first mortgage bond
issuances. No regulatory approvals are necessary for Entergy Corporation to
issue securities. The current FERC-authorized short-term borrowing limits and
long-term financing authorization for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are
effective through July 2022. Entergy Arkansas has obtained first mortgage
bond/secured financing authorization from the APSC that extends through
December 2022. Entergy New Orleans also has obtained long-term financing
authorization from the City Council that extends through July 2022. Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have obtained long-term
financing authorization from the FERC that extends through July 2022 for
issuances by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities. In addition
to borrowings from commercial banks, the Registrant Subsidiaries may also
borrow from the Entergy System money pool and from other internal short-term
borrowing arrangements. The money pool and the other internal borrowing
arrangements are inter-company borrowing arrangements designed to reduce
Entergy’s subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings.
Borrowings from internal and external short-term borrowings combined may not
exceed the FERC-authorized limits. See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial
statements for further discussion of Entergy’s borrowing limits,
authorizations, and amounts outstanding.

  

Equity Issuances and Equity Distribution Program

  

Entergy Corporation currently expects to issue approximately $2.5 billion of
equity through 2024. Entergy is considering various methods, including, among
others, at the market distributions, block trades, and preferred equity
issuances. In January 2021, Entergy entered into an equity distribution sales
agreement with several counterparties establishing an at the market equity
distribution program, pursuant to which Entergy may offer and sell from time
to time shares of its common stock. The sales agreement provides that, in
addition to the issuance and sale of shares of Entergy common stock, Entergy
may also enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of its

21

common stock. The aggregate number of shares of common stock sold under this
sales agreement and under any forward sale agreement may not exceed an
aggregate gross sales price of $1 billion.

  

Cash Flow Activity

  

As shown in Entergy’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash flows for
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by $127 million in
2020 primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $224 million in storm spending in 2020 as compared to 2019
primarily due to spending in 2020 on Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and
Hurricane Zeta restoration. See “Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and
Hurricane Zeta” above for discussion of storm restoration efforts;

•the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in 2020 as compared
to the prior year. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
fuel and purchased power cost recovery;

•lower collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic;

•the effect of less favorable weather on billed Utility sales in 2020; and

•an increase of $32 million in incentive-based compensation payments in 2020.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•the decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income
taxes to Utility customers. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a
discussion of the regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;

•a decrease of $86 million in severance and retention payments in 2020 as
compared to 2019. See “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant
Power Business” above for a discussion of management’s strategy to exit the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant power business;

•a decrease of $83 million in pension contributions in 2020 as compared to
2019. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial
statements for discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement
benefits funding;

•an increase of $71 million in proceeds received from the DOE resulting from
litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously
expensed. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent
nuclear fuel litigation;

•the timing of payments to vendors;

•a decrease of $34 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages; and

22

Table of Contents

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•an increase of $25 million of nuclear insurance refunds.

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by $262 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $942 million in storm spending in 2020, primarily on Hurricane
Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration. See “Hurricane Laura,
Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta” above for discussion of storm restoration
efforts;

•the purchase of Washington Parish Energy Center by Entergy Louisiana in
November 2020 for approximately $222 million. See Note 14 to the financial
statements for further discussion of the Washington Parish Energy Center
purchase;

•an increase of $140 million in distribution construction expenditures
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of the
distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering
infrastructure;

•an increase of $87 million in nuclear fuel purchases due to variations from
year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, materials
and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear
fuel cycle;

•an increase of $43 million primarily due to changes in collateral posted to
provide credit support to secure its obligations under agreements to sell
power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ power plants; and

•$25 million in plant upgrades for the Choctaw Generating Station in March
2020. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Choctaw
Generating Station purchase.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease of $309 million of non-nuclear generation construction
expenditures primarily due to higher spending in 2019 on the Montgomery County
Power Station, Lake Charles Power Station, and J. Wayne Leonard Power Station
(formerly St. Charles Power Station) projects;

•the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station in October 2019 for
approximately $305 million;

•an increase of $303 million in net receipts from storm reserve escrow
accounts;

•a decrease of $141 million in transmission construction expenditures
primarily due to the timing of work performed in 2020 as compared to 2019;

•an increase of $70 million in proceeds received from the DOE in 2020 as
compared to the prior year resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear
fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized. See Note 8 to the
financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation;

•a decrease of $44 million in information technology construction expenditures
primarily due to decreased spending on various technology projects; and

•a decrease of $23 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due
to a lower scope of work performed on various nuclear projects in 2020 as
compared to 2019.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased by $1,777 million in
2020 primarily due to:

  

•long-term debt activity providing approximately $4,467 million of cash in
2020 compared to providing approximately $1,685 million in 2019; and

•the repurchase in first quarter 2019 of $50 million of Class A mandatorily
redeemable preferred membership units in Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a
wholly-owned Entergy subsidiary, that were held by a third party.

  

23

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•proceeds of $608 million from the issuance of common stock in May 2019 as a
result of the settlement of equity forwards. See Note 7 to the financial
statements for discussion of the equity forward sale agreements;

•an increase of $324 million in net repayments of commercial paper in 2020
compared to 2019;

•a decrease of $52 million in treasury stock issuances in 2020 due to a larger
amount of previously repurchased Entergy Corporation common stock issued in
2019 to satisfy stock option exercises;

•an increase of $37 million in common stock dividends paid as a result of an
increase in the number of shares outstanding and an increase in the dividend
paid per share in 2020 compared to 2019; and

•the issuance of $35 million aggregate liquidation value 5.375% Series A
preferred stock in September 2019 by Entergy Texas.

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital
Resources \- Cash Flow Activity” in Item 7 of Entergy’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 21,
2020 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow
activities for 2019 compared to 2018.

  

Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation

  

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

  

The rates that the Utility operating companies charge for their services
significantly influence Entergy’s financial position, results of operations,
and liquidity. These companies are regulated and the rates charged to their
customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. Governmental agencies,
including the APSC, the LPSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the PUCT, are
primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Federal Regulation

  

The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate
transmission of electricity, including rates for System Energy’s sales of
capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales
Agreement. The current return on equity and capital structure of System Energy
are currently the subject of complaints filed by certain of the operating
companies’ retail regulators. The current return on equity under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement is 10.94%. Prior to each operating company’s termination
of participation in the System Agreement (Entergy

Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments

  

Market risk is the risk of changes in the value of commodity and financial
instruments, or in future net income or cash flows, in response to changing
market conditions. Entergy holds commodity and financial instruments that are
exposed to the following significant market risks.

  

•The commodity price risk associated with the sale of electricity by the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

•The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments
in pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds. See Note 11 to the
financial statements for details regarding Entergy’s pension and other
postretirement benefit trust funds.

•The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments
in nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds, particularly in the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business. See Note 16 to the financial statements for
details regarding Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds.

•The interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates as a result
of Entergy’s outstanding indebtedness. Entergy manages its interest rate
exposure by monitoring current interest rates and its debt outstanding in
relation to total capitalization. See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial
statements for the details of Entergy’s debt outstanding.

  

The Utility has limited exposure to the effects of market risk because it
operates primarily under cost-based rate regulation. To the extent approved by
their retail regulators, the Utility operating companies use commodity and
financial instruments to hedge the exposure to price volatility inherent in
their purchased power, fuel, and gas purchased for resale costs that are
recovered from customers.

  

Entergy’s commodity and financial instruments are also exposed to credit risk.
Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers,
or financial counterparties to a contract or agreement. Entergy is also
exposed to a potential demand on liquidity due to credit support requirements
within its supply or sales agreements.

  

Commodity Price Risk

  

Power Generation

  

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is
selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale
Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells
energy in the day ahead or spot markets. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also
sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified
reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their
respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward physical power
contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity
only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While
the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these
types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of
energy, make capacity available, or both. In addition to its forward physical
power contracts, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may also use a combination of
financial contracts,

including swaps, collars, and options, to manage forward commodity price risk.
The sensitivities may not reflect the total maximum upside potential from
higher market prices. The information contained in the following table
represents projections at a point in time and will vary over time based on
numerous factors, such as future market prices, contracting activities, and
generation. Following is a summary of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ current
forward capacity and generation contracts as well as total revenue projections
based on market prices as of December 31, 2020.

Some of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale
Commodities’ power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy
subsidiary to provide credit support to secure its obligations under the
agreements. The Entergy subsidiary is required to provide credit support based
upon the difference between the current market prices and contracted power
prices in the regions where Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells power. The
primary form of credit support to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy
Corporation guarantee. Cash and letters of credit are also acceptable forms of
credit support. At December 31, 2020, based on power prices at that time,
Entergy had liquidity exposure of $62 million under the guarantees in place
supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $6 million of posted
cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit
rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31,
2020, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of
additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of
December 31, 2020, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale
Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted
collateral from counterparties, would increase by $22 million for a $1 per
MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.

  

As of December 31, 2020, substantially all the credit exposure associated with
the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities
nuclear plants through 2022 is with counterparties or their guarantors that
have public investment grade credit ratings.

  

Nuclear Matters

  

Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses include the
ownership and operation of nuclear generating plants and are, therefore,
subject to the risks related to such ownership and operation. These include
risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level
and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements,
both for capital investments and operational needs, including the financial
requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of
certain materials within the plant systems to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet
to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these
nuclear plants; the risk of an adverse outcome to an expected challenge to the
prudence of operations at Grand Gulf; the implementation of plans to exit the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business by 2022 and the post-
shutdown decommissioning of these plants; regulatory requirements and
potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the
regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments,
and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged
for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund
assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required;
and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available
for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events
such as a nuclear accident.

  

NRC Reactor Oversight Process

  

The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about
plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and
provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant
performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting
from the NRC’s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the
licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the
NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: “licensee response
column,” or Column 1, “regulatory response column,” or Column 2, “degraded
cornerstone column,” or Column 3, and “multiple/repetitive degraded
cornerstone column,” or Column 4. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC
inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject
to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general,
progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Nuclear generating

plants owned and operated by Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale
Commodities businesses are currently in Column 1, except for Grand Gulf, which
is in Column 2.

  

In November 2020 the NRC placed Grand Gulf in Column 2 based on the incidence
of three unplanned plant scrams during the second and third quarters of 2020.
Two of the scram events related to new turbine control system components that
failed, and a third related to a feedwater valve positioner that failed, all
of which had been replaced in a refueling outage that ended in May 2020. The
NRC plans to conduct a supplemental inspection of Grand Gulf in accordance
with its inspection procedures for nuclear plants in Column 2. As a
consequence of two additional Grand Gulf scrams during the fourth quarter
2020, System Energy expects Grand Gulf to be placed into Column 3 based on
plant performance indicators for the four quarters ended December 31, 2020.
This will involve an additional supplemental NRC inspection of Grand Gulf in
accordance with its inspection procedures for nuclear plants in Column 3.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy’s financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate
accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a
significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting estimates as
critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a
high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a
material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.

  

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

  

Entergy subsidiaries own nuclear generation facilities in both the Utility and
Entergy Wholesale Commodities operating segments. Regulations require Entergy
subsidiaries to decommission the nuclear power plants after each facility is
taken out of service, and cash is deposited in trust funds during the
facilities’ operating lives in order to provide for this obligation. Entergy
conducts periodic decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will
be incurred to decommission the facilities. The following key assumptions have
a significant effect on these estimates.

  

•Timing \- In projecting decommissioning costs, two assumptions must be made
to estimate the timing of plant decommissioning. First, the date of the
plant’s retirement must be estimated for those plants that do not have an
announced shutdown date. The estimate may include assumptions regarding the
possibility that the plant may have an operating life shorter than the
operating license expiration. Second, an assumption must be made regarding
whether all decommissioning activity will proceed immediately upon plant
retirement, or whether the plant will be placed in SAFSTOR status. SAFSTOR is
decommissioning a facility by placing it in a safe, stable condition that is
maintained until it is subsequently decontaminated and dismantled to levels
that permit license termination, normally within 60 years from permanent
cessation of operations. A change of assumption regarding either the period of
continued operation, the use of a SAFSTOR period, or whether Entergy will
continue to hold the plant or the plant is held for sale can change the
present value of the asset retirement obligation.

•Cost Escalation Factors \- Entergy’s current decommissioning cost studies
include an assumption that decommissioning costs will escalate over present
cost levels by factors ranging from approximately 2% to 3% annually. A
50-basis point change in this assumption could change the estimated present
value of the decommissioning liabilities by approximately 6% to 18%. The
timing assumption influences the significance of the effect of a change in the
estimated inflation or cost escalation rate because the effect increases with
the length of time assumed before decommissioning activity ends.

•Spent Fuel Disposal \- Federal law requires the DOE to provide for the
permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel, and legislation has been passed by
Congress to develop a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE has not
yet begun accepting spent nuclear fuel and is in non-compliance with federal
law. The DOE

28

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

continues to delay meeting its obligation and Entergy’s nuclear plant owners
are continuing to pursue damage claims against the DOE for its failure to
provide timely spent fuel storage. Until a federal site is available, however,
nuclear plant operators must provide for interim spent fuel storage on the
nuclear plant site, which can require the construction and maintenance of dry
cask storage sites or other facilities. The costs of developing and
maintaining these facilities during the decommissioning period can have a
significant effect (as much as an average of 20% to 30% of total estimated
decommissioning costs). Entergy’s decommissioning studies include cost
estimates for spent fuel storage. These estimates could change in the future,
however, based on the expected timing of when the DOE begins to fulfill its
obligation to receive and store spent nuclear fuel. See Note 8 to the
financial statements for further discussion of Entergy’s spent nuclear fuel
litigation.

•Technology and Regulation \- Over the past several years, more practical
experience with the actual decommissioning of nuclear facilities has been
gained and that experience has been incorporated into Entergy’s current
decommissioning cost estimates. Given the long duration of decommissioning
projects, additional experience, including technological advancements in
decommissioning, could be gained and affect current cost estimates. In
addition, if regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning were to change,
this could affect cost estimates.

•Interest Rates \- The estimated decommissioning costs that are the basis for
the recorded decommissioning liability are discounted to present value using a
credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the decommissioning liability is revised,
increases in cash flows are discounted using the current credit-adjusted risk-
free rate. Decreases in estimated cash flows are discounted using the credit-
adjusted risk-free rate used previously in estimating the decommissioning
liability that is being revised. Therefore, to the extent that a revised cost
study results in an increase in estimated cash flows, a change in interest
rates from the time of the previous cost estimate will affect the calculation
of the present value of the revised decommissioning liability.

  

Revisions of estimated decommissioning costs that decrease the liability also
result in a decrease in the asset retirement cost asset. For the non-rate-
regulated portions of Entergy’s business for which the plant’s value is
impaired, these reductions will immediately reduce operating expenses in the
period of the revision if the reduction of the liability exceeds the amount of
the undepreciated plant asset at the date of the revision. Revisions of
estimated decommissioning costs that increase the liability result in an
increase in the asset retirement cost asset, which is then depreciated over
the asset’s remaining economic life. For a plant in the non-rate-regulated
portions of Entergy’s business for which the plant’s value is impaired,
however, including a plant that is shutdown, or is nearing its shutdown date,
the increase in the liability is likely to immediately increase operating
expense in the period of the revision and not increase the asset retirement
cost asset. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of
impairment of long-lived assets and Note 9 to the financial statements for
further discussion of asset retirement obligations.

  

Utility Regulatory Accounting

  

Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy are subject to retail
regulation by their respective state and local regulators and to wholesale
regulation by the FERC. Because these regulatory agencies set the rates the
Utility operating companies and System Energy are allowed to charge customers
based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Utility
operating companies and System Energy apply accounting standards that require
the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including
the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of
future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities
represent the excess recovery of costs that have been deferred because it is
probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated
rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of rate and
regulatory matters, including details of Entergy’s and the Registrant
Subsidiaries’ regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.

  

For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, the Utility
operating companies and System Energy assess whether the regulatory assets and
regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future
recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events
occur. This

29

Table of Contents

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory
treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable
regulatory and political environments. If the assessments made by the Utility
operating companies and System Energy are ultimately different than actual
regulatory outcomes, it could materially affect the results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows of Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

  

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

  

Entergy has significant investments in long-lived assets in both of its
operating segments, and Entergy evaluates these assets against the market
economics and under the accounting rules for impairment when there are
indications that an impairment may exist. This evaluation involves a
significant degree of estimation and uncertainty. In the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business, Entergy’s investments in merchant generation assets are
subject to impairment if adverse market or regulatory conditions arise,
particularly if it leads to a decision or an expectation that Entergy will
operate or own a plant for a shorter period than previously expected; if there
is a significant adverse change in the physical condition of a plant; or, if
capital investment in a plant significantly exceeds previously-expected
amounts.

  

If an asset is considered held for use, and Entergy concludes that events and
circumstances are present indicating that an impairment analysis should be
performed under the accounting standards, the sum of the expected undiscounted
future cash flows from the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying value.
The carrying value of the asset includes any capitalized asset retirement cost
associated with the decommissioning liability; therefore, changes in
assumptions that affect the decommissioning liability can increase or decrease
the carrying value of the asset subject to impairment. If the expected
undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is
recorded. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the
carrying value and the carrying value exceeds the fair value, Entergy is
required to record an impairment charge to write the asset down to its fair
value. If an asset is considered held for sale, an impairment is required to
be recognized if the fair value (less costs to sell) of the asset is less than
its carrying value.

  

The expected future cash flows are based on a number of key assumptions,
including:

  

•Future power and fuel prices \- Electricity and gas prices can be very
volatile. This volatility increases the imprecision inherent in the long-term
forecasts of commodity prices that are a key determinant of estimated future
cash flows.

•Market value of generation assets \- Valuing assets held for sale requires
estimating the current market value of generation assets. While market
transactions provide evidence for this valuation, these transactions are
relatively infrequent, the market for such assets is volatile, and the value
of individual assets is affected by factors unique to those assets.

•Future operating costs \- Entergy assumes relatively minor annual increases
in operating costs. Technological or regulatory changes that have a
significant effect on operations could cause a significant change in these
assumptions.

•Timing and the life of the asset \- Entergy assumes an expected life of the
asset. A change in the timing assumption, whether due to management decisions
regarding operation of the plant, the regulatory process, or operational or
other factors, could have a significant effect on the expected future cash
flows and result in a significant effect on operations.

  

See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment
conclusions related to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.

  

Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions

  

Management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the potential tax
effects of Entergy’s operations, transactions, and other events. Entergy
accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a recognition model under

30

* * *

Table of Contents

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

a two-step approach with a more likely-than-not recognition threshold and a
measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Management
evaluates each tax position based on the technical merits and facts and
circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a
taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
Significant judgment is required to determine whether available information
supports the assertion that the recognition threshold has been met.
Additionally, measurement of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the
consolidated financial statements is based on the probability of different
potential outcomes. Income tax expense and tax positions recorded could be
significantly affected by events such as additional transactions contemplated
or consummated by Entergy as well as audits by taxing authorities of the tax
positions taken in transactions. Management believes that the financial
statement tax balances are accounted for and adjusted appropriately each
quarter as necessary in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance;
however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or
unfavorable effects on the consolidated financial statements. Entergy’s income
taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, open audits, and other significant
tax matters are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

  

Included in the IRS examination of Entergy’s 2015 tax returns is the tax
effect of the October 2015 combination of two Entergy utility companies,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana
maintained a carryover tax basis in the assets received and the tax
consequences provided for an increase in tax basis as well. This resulted in
recognition in 2015 of a $334 million permanent difference and income tax
benefit, net of the uncertain tax position recorded on the transaction. As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the IRS completed its
examination of the 2014 and 2015 tax years and issued its 2014-2015 Revenue
Agent Report in November 2020. Entergy Louisiana reversed the provision for
uncertain tax positions with respect to the business combination. See
additional discussion of the 2014 and 2015 IRS audit in Note 3 to the
financial statements.

  

In addition, as discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, in 2015,
System Energy and Entergy Louisiana adopted a new method of accounting for
income tax return purposes in which nuclear decommissioning liabilities are
treated as production costs of electricity includable in cost of goods sold.
The new method resulted in a reduction of taxable income of $1.2 billion for
System Energy and $2.2 billion for Entergy Louisiana in 2015. In the third
quarter 2020 the IRS issued Notices of Proposed Adjustment concerning this
uncertain tax position allowing System Energy to include $102 million of its
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold and Entergy Louisiana to
include $221 million of its decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold.
The Notices of Proposed Adjustment will not be appealed.

  

As a result of System Energy being allowed to include part of its
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold, System Energy and Entergy
recorded a deferred tax liability of $26 million. System Energy also recorded
federal and state taxes payable of $402 million; on a consolidated basis,
however, Entergy utilized tax loss carryovers to offset the federal taxable
income adjustment and accordingly did not record federal taxes payable as a
result of the outcome of this uncertain tax position.

  

As a result of Entergy Louisiana being allowed to include part of its
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
recorded a deferred tax liability of $60 million. Both Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy utilized tax loss carryovers to offset the taxable income adjustment
and accordingly did not record taxes payable as a result of the outcome of
this uncertain tax position.

  

The partial disallowance of the uncertain tax position to include the
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold resulted in a $1.5 billion
decrease in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and
state taxes for Entergy. Additionally, both System Energy and Entergy
Louisiana recorded a reduction to their balances of unrecognized tax benefits
for federal and state taxes of $461 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.

  

The tax treatment of Entergy Louisiana’s accrued regulatory liabilities
associated with the Vidalia purchased power agreement and business combination
guaranteed customer credits, which are discussed in Note 2

to the financial statements, has been resolved in a manner that results in a
$190 million increase to previously reported taxable income. Entergy Louisiana
and Entergy utilized tax loss carryovers to offset the taxable income
adjustment, however, which allowed both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy to
reduce their balances of federal and state unrecognized tax benefits by $74
million.

  

See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal income tax legislation enacted in December
2017.

  

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

  

Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover
substantially all employees, including cash balance plans and final average
pay plans. Additionally, Entergy currently provides other postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all full-time
employees whose most recent date of hire or rehire is before July 1, 2014 and
who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still
working for Entergy.

  

Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11
to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the
provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. Because of the
complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations,
and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these
costs is a critical accounting estimate for the Utility and Entergy Wholesale
Commodities segments.

  

Assumptions

  

Key actuarial assumptions utilized in determining qualified pension and other
postretirement health care and life insurance costs include discount rates,
projected healthcare cost rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets, rate of increase in future compensation levels, retirement rates,
expected timing and form of payments, and mortality rates.

  

Annually, Entergy reviews and, when necessary, adjusts the assumptions for the
pension and other postretirement plans. Every three-to-five years, a formal
actuarial assumption experience study that compares assumptions to the actual
experience of the pension and other postretirement health care and life
insurance plans is conducted. The interest rate environment over the past few
years and volatility in the financial equity markets have affected Entergy’s
funding and reported costs for these benefits.

  

Discount rates

  

In selecting an assumed discount rate to calculate benefit obligations,
Entergy uses a yield curve based on high-quality corporate debt with cash
flows matching the expected plan benefit payments. In estimating the service
cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, Entergy
discounts the expected cash flows by the applicable spot rates.

  

Projected health care cost trend rates

  

Entergy’s health care cost trend is affected by both medical cost inflation,
and with respect to capped costs under the plan, the effects of general
inflation. Entergy reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future
trends in establishing its health care cost trend rates.

  

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

  

In determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in
the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance,
current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market

assumptions of its investment consultant and some of its investment managers.
Entergy conducts periodic asset/liability studies in order to set its target
asset allocations.

  

In 2017, Entergy confirmed its liability-driven investment strategy for its
pension assets, which recommended that the target asset allocation adjust
dynamically over time, based on the funded status of the plan, to an ultimate
allocation of 35% equity securities and 65% fixed income securities. The
ultimate asset allocation is expected to be attained when the plan is 100%
funded. The target pension asset allocation for 2020 was 58% equity and 42%
fixed income securities.

  

In 2017, Entergy implemented a new asset allocation strategy for its non-
taxable and taxable other postretirement assets, based on the funded status of
each sub-account within each trust. The new strategy no longer focuses on
targeting an overall asset allocation for each trust, but rather a target
asset allocation for each sub-account within each trust that adjusts
dynamically based on the funded status. The 2020 weighted average target
postretirement asset allocation is 44% equity and 56% fixed income securities.
See Note 11 to the financial statements for discussion of the current asset
allocations for Entergy’s pension and other postretirement assets.

(a) In 2020 qualified pension cost included settlement costs of $36.9 million.

  

Actual asset returns have an effect on Entergy’s qualified pension and other
postretirement costs. In 2020, Entergy’s actual annual return on qualified
pension assets was approximately 16% and for other postretirement assets was
approximately 12%, as compared with the 2020 expected long-term rates of
return discussed above.

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation
are held constant.

  

Accounting Mechanisms

  

In accordance with pension accounting standards, Entergy utilizes a number of
accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs.
Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred
and are amortized into expense only when the accumulated differences exceed
10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related
value of plan assets. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average
remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life
expectancy of plan participants if almost all are inactive. Additionally,
accounting standards allow for the deferral of prior service costs/credits
arising from plan amendments that attribute an increase or decrease in
benefits to employee service in prior periods. Prior service costs/credits are
then amortized into expense over the average future working life of active
employees. Certain decisions, including workforce reductions, plan amendments,
and plant shutdowns may significantly reduce the expense amortization period
and result in immediate recognition of certain previously-deferred costs and
gains/losses in the form of curtailment gains or losses. Similarly, payments
made to settle benefit obligations, including lump sum benefit payments, can
also result in accelerated recognition in the form of settlement losses or
gains.

  

Entergy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets by multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on
assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets. In general, Entergy
determines the MRV of its pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses
a 20-quarter phase-in of the difference between actual and expected returns
and for its other postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value.

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Accounting standards require an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the
funded status of its benefit plans. See Note 11 to the financial statements
for a further discussion of Entergy’s funded status.

  

Employer Contributions

  

Entergy contributed $316.3 million to its qualified pension plans in 2020.
Entergy estimates pension contributions will be approximately $356 million in
2021; although the 2021 required pension contributions will be known with more
certainty when the January 1, 2021 valuations are completed, which is expected
by April 1, 2021.

  

Minimum required funding calculations as determined under Pension Protection
Act guidance are performed annually as of January 1 of each year and are based
on measurements of the assets and funding liabilities as measured at that
date. Any excess of the funding liability over the calculated fair market
value of assets results in a funding shortfall that, under the Pension
Protection Act, must be funded over a seven-year rolling period. The Pension
Protection Act also imposes certain plan limitations if the funded percentage,
which is based on calculated fair market values of assets divided by funding
liabilities, does not meet certain thresholds. For funding purposes, asset
gains and losses are smoothed in to the calculated fair market value of
assets. The funding liability is based upon a weighted average 24-month
corporate bond rate published by the U.S. Treasury which is generally subject
to a corridor of the 25-year average of prior segment rates. Periodic changes
in asset returns and interest rates can affect funding shortfalls and future
cash contributions.

  

Entergy contributed $48.2 million to its postretirement plans in 2020 and
plans to contribute $39.9 million in 2021.

  

Other Contingencies

  

As a company with multi-state utility operations, Entergy is subject to a
number of federal and state laws and regulations and other factors and
conditions in the areas in which it operates, which potentially subjects it to
environmental, litigation, and other risks. Entergy periodically evaluates its
exposure for such risks and records a provision for those matters which are
considered probable and estimable in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

  

Environmental

  

Entergy must comply with environmental laws and regulations applicable to air
emissions, water discharges, solid waste (including coal combustion
residuals), hazardous waste, toxic substances, protected species, and other
environmental matters. Under these various laws and regulations, Entergy could
incur substantial costs to comply or address any impacts to the environment.
Entergy conducts studies to determine the extent of any required remediation
and has recorded liabilities based upon its evaluation of the likelihood of
loss and expected dollar amount for each issue. Additional sites or issues
could be identified which require environmental remediation or corrective
action for which Entergy could be liable. The amounts of environmental
liabilities recorded can be significantly affected by the following external
events or conditions.

  

•Changes to existing federal, state, or local regulation by governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of
toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.

•The identification of additional impacts, sites, issues, or the filing of
other complaints in which Entergy may be asserted to be a potentially
responsible party.

•The resolution or progression of existing matters through the court system or
resolution by the EPA or relevant state or local authority.

Litigation

  

Entergy is regularly named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits involving
employment, customers, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters.
Entergy periodically reviews the cases in which it has been named as defendant
and assesses the likelihood of loss in each case as probable, reasonably
possible, or remote and records liabilities for cases that have a probable
likelihood of loss and the loss can be estimated. Given the environment in
which Entergy operates, and the unpredictable nature of many of the cases in
which Entergy is named as a defendant, the ultimate outcome of the litigation
to which Entergy is exposed has the potential to materially affect the results
of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Entergy or the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

  

Management of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries has prepared and is
responsible for the financial statements and related financial information
included in this document. To meet this responsibility, management establishes
and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. This system includes communication through written
policies and procedures, an employee Code of Entegrity, and an organizational
structure that provides for appropriate division of responsibility and
training of personnel. This system is also tested by a comprehensive internal
audit program.

  

Entergy management assesses the design and effectiveness of Entergy’s internal
control over financial reporting on an annual basis. In making this
assessment, management uses the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework. The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized for management’s
assessment. Management acknowledges, however, that all internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

  

Entergy Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte
& Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Entergy
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2020.

  

In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of
independent Directors, meets with the independent auditors, internal auditors,
management, and internal accountants periodically to discuss internal
controls, and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee
appoints the independent auditors annually, seeks shareholder ratification of
the appointment, and reviews with the independent auditors the scope and
results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with
the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management
present, providing free access to the Audit Committee.

  

Based on management’s assessment of internal controls using the 2013 COSO
criteria, management believes that Entergy and each of the Registrant
Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2020. Management further believes that this assessment,
combined with the policies and procedures noted above, provides reasonable
assurance that Entergy’s and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ financial
statements are fairly and accurately presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, referred to as
the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as
of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Corporation in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matters

  

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on
the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries—Refer to
Note 2 to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Corporation is subject to rate regulation by the Arkansas Public Service
Commission, Louisiana Public Service Commission, Mississippi Public Service
Commission, City Council of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Public Utility
Commission of Texas (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect
to the rates of electric companies in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas,
and the City of New Orleans, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America to prepare its financial statements applying

the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate
regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple
financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and
equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes; operating
revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization
expense.

  

The Corporation’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the Commissions and the FERC set the rates,
the Corporation is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs,
including a reasonable return on equity, and the Corporation applies
accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the
effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and
liabilities. The Corporation assesses whether the regulatory assets and
regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future
recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events
occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders,
historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes
in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Corporation has
indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates,
there is a risk that the Commissions and the FERC will not approve: (1) full
recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of
amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that
investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the (1) likelihood of
recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) likelihood of refunds to
customers, and (3) ongoing complaints filed with the FERC against System
Energy. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future
decisions by the Commissions and the FERC involved especially subjective
judgment and specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the
rate-setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
Commissions and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets; and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

  

•We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

  

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions and the FERC for
the Corporation and other public utilities, regulatory statutes,
interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and
other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the
Commissions’ and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar
circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to
management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for
completeness.

  

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Corporation’s filings
with the Commissions and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan
filings, base rate case filings, and open complaints filed with the FERC
against System Energy, and considered the filings with the Commissions and the
FERC by intervenors that may impact the Corporation’s future rates, for any
evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.

  

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from the Corporation’s
internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of
recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for
regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, including the
complaints filed with the FERC against System Energy, to assess management’s
assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in
rates.

Uncertain Tax Positions—Entergy Wholesale Commodities—Refer to Note 3 to the
financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Corporation accounts for uncertain income tax positions under a two-step
approach with a more likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement
approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty
percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Corporation has
uncertain tax positions which require management to make significant judgments
and assumptions to determine whether available information supports the
assertion that the recognition threshold is met, particularly related to the
technical merits and facts and circumstances of each position, as well as the
probability of different potential outcomes. These uncertain tax positions
could be significantly affected by events such as additional transactions
contemplated or consummated by the Corporation as well as audits by taxing
authorities of the tax positions. The net unrecognized tax benefit of $979
million at December 31, 2020, includes uncertain tax positions related to
Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

  

Given the subjectivity of estimating these uncertain tax positions, auditing
the uncertain tax positions involved especially subjective judgment.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertain tax positions included the
following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of controls related to uncertain tax positions,
including those over the recognition and measurement of the income tax
benefits.

  

•We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures, and the balances recorded,
related to uncertain tax positions.

  

•We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the
uncertain tax positions by testing the underlying data that served as the
basis for the uncertain tax position.

  

•With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we tested the technical
merits of the uncertain tax positions and management’s key estimates and
judgments made by:

  

◦Assessing the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions by comparing to
similar cases filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

◦

◦Evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of the probabilities applied to
the uncertain tax position by comparing to probabilities used on similar
uncertain tax positions.

◦

◦Considering the impact of changes or settlements in the tax environment on
management’s methods and assumptions used to estimate the uncertain tax
positions.

  

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs—Entergy Wholesale Commodities—Refer to Note 9 to
the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Corporation owns nuclear generation facilities in the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities operating segment where regulation requires the Corporation to
decommission its nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of
service. The Corporation periodically conducts decommissioning cost studies,
which requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions,
specifically related to future dismantlement, site restoration, spent fuel
management, and license termination costs. The liability for Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear decommissioning was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020.

  

Auditing management’s judgments regarding the nuclear decommissioning costs,
including estimates for future dismantlement, site restoration, spent fuel
management, and license termination costs, involved especially subjective
judgment in evaluating the appropriateness of the estimates and assumptions.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the underlying costs for nuclear
decommissioning included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of the control over nuclear decommissioning where
management evaluates whether estimates and assumptions need to be updated for
each of the nuclear power plants.

  

•We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures related to the estimated nuclear
decommissioning costs, including the balances recorded.

  

•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate the costs for
nuclear decommissioning by comparing the cost estimates to actual nuclear
decommissioning costs of similar asset retirement obligations at the
Corporation.

  

•With the assistance of our environmental specialists, we completed a search
of environmental regulations to evaluate any regulatory changes that may
affect the nuclear decommissioning cost estimates.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Entergy Corporation,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. As required by generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, all intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Entergy’s Registrant Subsidiaries (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)
also include their separate financial statements in this Form 10-K. The
Registrant Subsidiaries and many other Entergy subsidiaries also maintain
accounts in accordance with FERC and other regulatory guidelines.

  

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

  

In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America, the preparation of Entergy Corporation’s consolidated
financial statements and the separate financial statements of the Registrant
Subsidiaries requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Adjustments to the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities may be necessary in the future to the extent
that future estimates or actual results are different from the estimates used.

  

Revenues and Fuel Costs

  

See Note 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy’s and the
Registrant Subsidiaries’ revenues and fuel costs.

  

Property, Plant, and Equipment

  

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line
basis at rates based on the applicable estimated service lives of the various
classes of property. For the Registrant Subsidiaries, the original cost of
plant retired or removed, less salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation. Normal maintenance, repairs, and minor replacement costs are
charged to operating expenses. Certain combined-cycle gas turbine generating
units are maintained under long-term service agreements with third-party
service providers. The costs under these agreements are split between
operating expenses and capital additions based upon the nature of the work
performed. Substantially all of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ plant is subject
to mortgage liens.

  

Electric plant includes the portion of Grand Gulf that was sold and leased
back in a prior period. For financial reporting purposes, this sale and
leaseback arrangement is reported as a financing transaction.

Depreciation rates on average depreciable property for Entergy approximated
2.8% in 2020, 2.8% in 2019, and 2.8% in 2018. Included in these rates are the
depreciation rates on average depreciable Utility property of 2.7% in 2020,
2.6% in 2019, and 2.6% in 2018, and the depreciation rates on average
depreciable Entergy Wholesale Commodities property of 12.7% in 2020, 18.3% in
2019, and 18.6% in 2018. The depreciation rates for Entergy Wholesale
Commodities reflect the significantly reduced remaining estimated operating
lives associated with management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of the
remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet. The
decrease in the depreciation rate in 2020 for Entergy Wholesale Commodities is
due to the shutdown of Indian Point 2 in April 2020.

  

Entergy amortizes nuclear fuel using a units-of-production method. Nuclear
fuel amortization is included in fuel expense in the income statements.
Because the values of their long-lived assets are impaired, and their
remaining estimated operating lives significantly reduced, the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, except for Palisades, charge nuclear
fuel costs directly to expense when incurred because their undiscounted cash
flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of these capital
additions.

  

Non-utility property - at cost (less accumulated depreciation) for Entergy is
reported net of accumulated depreciation of $191 million as of December 31,
2020 and $184 million as of December 31, 2019.

Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs

  

Nuclear refueling outage costs are deferred during the outage and amortized
over the estimated period to the next outage because these refueling outage
expenses are incurred to prepare the units to operate for the next operating
cycle without having to be taken off line. Because the value of their long-
lived assets are impaired, and their remaining estimated operating lives
significantly reduced, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants,
except for Palisades, charge nuclear refueling outage costs directly to
expense when incurred because their undiscounted cash flows are insufficient
to recover the carrying amount of these costs.

  

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

  

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds
and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction by the
Registrant Subsidiaries. AFUDC increases both the plant balance and earnings
and is realized in cash through depreciation provisions included in the rates
charged to customers.

  

Income Taxes

  

Entergy Corporation and the majority of its subsidiaries file a United States
consolidated federal income tax return. In September 2019, Entergy Utility
Holding Company, LLC and its regulated wholly-owned subsidiaries including
Entergy Arkansas, LLC, Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Mississippi, LLC, and
Entergy New Orleans, LLC became eligible to join and joined the Entergy
Corporation consolidated federal income tax group. These changes do not affect
the accrual or allocation of income taxes for the Registrant Subsidiaries.
Each tax-paying entity records income taxes as if it were a separate taxpayer
and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the tax filing entities in
accordance with Entergy’s intercompany income tax allocation agreements.
Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the book
and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for certain losses and credits
available for carryforward.

  

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion
of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates in the period in
which the tax or rate was enacted. See the “Other Tax Matters \- Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act” section in Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the
effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.

  

The benefits of investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the
average useful life of the related property, as a reduction of income tax
expense, for such credits associated with rate-regulated operations in
accordance with ratemaking treatment.

antidilutive.

  

Stock-based Compensation Plans

  

Entergy grants stock options, restricted stock, performance units, and
restricted stock unit awards to key employees of the Entergy subsidiaries
under its Equity Ownership Plans, which are shareholder-approved stock-based
compensation plans. These plans are described more fully in Note 12 to the
financial statements. The cost of the stock-based compensation is charged to
income over the vesting period. Awards under Entergy’s plans generally vest
over three years. Entergy accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation
when they occur. Entergy recognizes all income tax effects related to share-
based payments through the income statement.

  

Accounting for the Effects of Regulation

  

Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy are rate-regulated
enterprises whose rates meet three criteria specified in accounting standards.
The Utility operating companies and System Energy have rates that (i) are
approved by a body (its regulator) empowered to set rates that bind customers;
(ii) are cost-based; and (iii) can be charged to and collected from customers.
These criteria may also be applied to separable portions of a utility’s
business, such as the generation or transmission functions, or to specific
classes of customers. Because the Utility operating companies and System
Energy meet these criteria, each of them capitalizes costs that would
otherwise be charged to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it
probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. Such
capitalized costs are reflected as regulatory assets in the accompanying
financial statements. When an enterprise concludes that recovery of a
regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset must be removed
from the entity’s balance sheet.

  

An enterprise that ceases to meet the three criteria for all or part of its
operations should report that event in its financial statements. In general,
the enterprise no longer meeting the criteria should eliminate from its
balance sheet all regulatory assets and liabilities related to the applicable
operations. Additionally, if it is determined that a regulated enterprise is
no longer recovering all of its costs, it is possible that an impairment may
exist that could require further write-offs of plant assets.

Entergy Louisiana does not apply regulatory accounting standards to the
Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend, the 30% interest in River
Bend formerly owned by Cajun, or its steam business, unless specific cost
recovery is provided for in tariff rates. The Louisiana retail deregulated
portion of River Bend is operated under a deregulated asset plan representing
a portion (approximately 15%) of River Bend plant costs, generation, revenues,
and expenses established under a 1992 LPSC order. The plan allows Entergy
Louisiana to sell the electricity from the deregulated assets to Louisiana
retail customers at 4.6 cents per kWh or off-system at higher prices, with
certain provisions for sharing incremental revenue above 4.6 cents per kWh
between customers and shareholders.

  

Regulatory Asset or Liability for Income Taxes

  

Accounting standards for income taxes provide that a regulatory asset or
liability be recorded if it is probable that the currently determinable future
increase or decrease in regulatory income tax expense will be recovered from
or returned to customers through future rates. There are two main sources of
Entergy’s regulatory asset or liability for income taxes. There is a
regulatory asset related to the ratemaking treatment of the tax effects of
book depreciation for the equity component of AFUDC that has been capitalized
to property, plant, and equipment but for which there is no corresponding tax
basis. Equity-AFUDC is a component of property, plant, and equipment that is
included in rate base when the plant is placed in service. There is a
regulatory liability related to the adjustment of Entergy’s net deferred
income taxes that was required by the enactment in December 2017 of a change
in the federal corporate income tax rate, which is discussed in Note 2 and 3
to the financial statements.

  

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  

Entergy considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.

  

Securitization Recovery Trust Accounts

  

The funds that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and
Entergy Texas hold in their securitization recovery trust accounts are not
classified as cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash and cash
equivalents because of their nature, uses, and restrictions. These funds are
classified as part of other current assets and other investments, depending on
the timeframe within which the Registrant Subsidiary expects to use the funds.

  

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

  

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects Entergy’s best estimate of losses
on the accounts receivable balances. The allowance is calculated as the
historical rate of customer write-offs multiplied by the current accounts
receivable balance, taking into account the length of time the receivable
balances have been outstanding. Although the rate of customer write-offs has
historically experienced minimal variation, management monitors the current
condition of individual customer accounts to manage collections and ensure bad
debt expense is recorded in a timely manner. Utility operating company
customer accounts receivable are written off consistent with approved
regulatory requirements. See Note 19 to the financial statements for further
details on the allowance for doubtful accounts.

  

Investments

  

Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities held by
the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recorded in earnings as they occur
rather than in other comprehensive income. Because of the ability of the
Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in
accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the
Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized
gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory
liabilities/assets. For the 30% interest in River Bend formerly owned by
Cajun,

58

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

  

Entergy Louisiana records an offsetting amount in other deferred credits for
the unrealized trust earnings not currently expected to be needed to
decommission the plant. Decommissioning trust funds for the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear plants do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting
treatment. Accordingly, unrealized gains/(losses) recorded on the equity
securities in the trust funds are recognized in earnings. Unrealized gains
recorded on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are
recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of
shareholders’ equity. Unrealized losses (where cost exceeds fair market value)
on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are also recorded
in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’
equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and therefore
recorded in earnings. A portion of Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds were
held in a wholly-owned registered investment company, and unrealized gains and
losses on both the equity and debt securities held in the registered
investment company were recognized in earnings. In December 2020, Entergy
liquidated its interest in the registered investment company. The assessment
of whether an investment in an available-for-sale debt security has suffered
an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent
to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security
before recovery of its amortized costs. Further, if Entergy does not expect to
recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-
temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the
present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost
basis (credit loss). Effective January 1, 2020, with the adoption of ASU
2016-13, Entergy estimates the expected credit losses for its available for
sale securities based on the current credit rating and remaining life of the
securities. To the extent an expected credit loss is realized, the individual
security comprising the loss is written off against this allowance. Entergy’s
trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements
that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and
sales of investments. See Note 16 to the financial statements for details on
the decommissioning trust funds.

  

Equity Method Investments

  

Entergy owns investments that are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting because Entergy’s ownership level results in significant influence,
but not control, over the investee and its operations. Entergy records its
share of the investee’s comprehensive earnings and losses in income and as an
increase or decrease to the investment account. Any cash distributions are
charged against the investment account. Entergy discontinues the recognition
of losses on equity investments when its share of losses equals or exceeds its
carrying amount for an investee plus any advances made or commitments to
provide additional financial support.

  

Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Derivatives

  

The accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities
require that all derivatives be recognized at fair value on the balance sheet,
either as assets or liabilities, unless they meet various exceptions including
the normal purchase/normal sale criteria. The changes in the fair value of
recognized derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part
of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction. Due to regulatory
treatment, an offsetting regulatory asset or liability is recorded for changes
in fair value of recognized derivatives for the Registrant Subsidiaries.

  

Contracts for commodities that will be physically delivered in quantities
expected to be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, including
certain purchases and sales of power and fuel, meet the normal purchase,
normal sales criteria and are not recognized on the balance sheet. Revenues
and expenses from these contracts are reported on a gross basis in the
appropriate revenue and expense categories as the commodities are received or
delivered.

  

For other contracts for commodities in which Entergy is hedging the
variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or
forecasted transactions that qualify as cash flow hedges, the changes in the
fair value of such derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive
income. To qualify for hedge accounting, the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item must be documented to include the risk

management objective and strategy and, at inception and on an ongoing basis,
the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of
the item being hedged. Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to earnings in the periods when the underlying
transactions actually occur. Prior to 2019, the ineffective portions of all
hedges are recognized in current-period earnings. Effective January 1, 2019
with the adoption of ASU 2017-12 there will no longer be separate recognition
of the ineffective portion of highly effective hedges. Changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges
are recorded in current-period earnings on a mark-to-market basis.

  

Entergy has determined that contracts to purchase uranium do not meet the
definition of a derivative under the accounting standards for derivative
instruments because they do not provide for net settlement and the uranium
markets are not sufficiently liquid to conclude that forward contracts are
readily convertible to cash. If the uranium markets do become sufficiently
liquid in the future and Entergy begins to account for uranium purchase
contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would
be accounted for consistent with Entergy’s other derivative instruments. See
Note 15 to the financial statements for further details on Entergy’s
derivative instruments and hedging activities.

  

Fair Values

  

The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives
are determined using historical prices, bid prices, market quotes, and
financial modeling. Considerable judgment is required in developing the
estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange. Gains
or losses realized on financial instruments other than those instruments held
by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are reflected in future rates
and therefore do not affect net income. Entergy considers the carrying amounts
of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to
be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments. See Note 15 to the financial statements for further
discussion of fair value.

  

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

  

Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business
segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of
recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result
from such operations and assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the
expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated
with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating
units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the
remaining life of the assets. Because the values of the long-lived assets are
impaired, and the remaining estimated operating lives significantly reduced,
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, except for Palisades, are
charging additional expenditures for capital assets directly to expense when
incurred. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussions of
the impairments of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.

  

River Bend AFUDC

  

The River Bend AFUDC gross-up is a regulatory asset that represents the
incremental difference imputed by the LPSC between the AFUDC actually recorded
by Entergy Louisiana on a net-of-tax basis during the construction of River
Bend and what the AFUDC would have been on a pre-tax basis. The imputed amount
was only calculated on that portion of River Bend that the LPSC allowed in
rate base and is being amortized through August 2025.

  

Reacquired Debt

  

The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt of Entergy’s Utility
operating companies and System Energy (except that portion allocable to the
deregulated operations of Entergy Louisiana) are included in

60

regulatory assets and are being amortized over the life of the related new
issuances, or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not
refinanced, in accordance with ratemaking treatment.

  

Taxes Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions

  

Governmental authorities assess taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer,
including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.
Entergy presents these taxes on a net basis, excluding them from revenues,
unless required to report them differently by a regulatory authority.

  

New Accounting Pronouncements

  

In December 2019 the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The ASU removes certain
exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intra-
period allocation, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU
also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including allocating
taxes to members of a consolidated group. Entergy adopted ASU 2019-12 in the
first quarter 2021 on a prospective basis. Entergy does not expect that the
adoption of ASU 2019-12 will materially affect its results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta

  

In August and October 2020, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta caused significant damage to portions of the Utility’s service
territories in Louisiana, including New Orleans, Texas, and, to a lesser
extent, in Arkansas and Mississippi. The storms resulted in widespread power
outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure,
and the loss of sales during the outages. Additionally, as a result of
Hurricane Laura’s extensive damage to the grid infrastructure serving the
impacted area, large portions of the underlying transmission system required
nearly a complete rebuild. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or
replacement of the electrical system damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane
Delta, and Hurricane Zeta are currently estimated to be approximately $2.4
billion, including $2.0 billion at Entergy Louisiana, $300 million at Entergy
Texas, and $40 million at Entergy New Orleans. The estimate includes
approximately $1.98 billion in capital costs, including $1.67 billion at
Entergy Louisiana, $245 million at Entergy Texas, and $30 million at Entergy
New Orleans and approximately $420 million in non-capital costs, including
$330 million at Entergy Louisiana, $55 million at Entergy Texas, and $10
million at Entergy New Orleans. This estimate includes all costs to restore
power and repair or replace the damages from the hurricanes, except for the
cost to repair or replace damage incurred to an Entergy Louisiana transmission
line in southeast Louisiana, and the amount of that cost could be significant.
The restoration plan for this transmission line and the related cost estimate
is still being evaluated.

  

Entergy recorded accounts payable and corresponding construction work in
progress and regulatory assets for the estimated costs incurred that were
necessary to return customers to service. Entergy recorded the regulatory
assets in accordance with its accounting policies and based on the historic
treatment of such costs in its service area because management believes that
recovery through some form of regulatory mechanism is probable. There are
well-established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these catastrophic
events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in
accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because Entergy
has not gone through the regulatory process regarding these storm costs, there
is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to predict with certainty the
degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives, the amount of
restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing of such
recovery.

  

The Utility operating companies are considering all available avenues to
recover storm-related costs from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and
Hurricane Zeta including accessing funded storm reserve escrows and
securitization. In November 2020, Entergy Louisiana drew $257 million from its
funded storm reserves. Each Utility operating company is responsible for its
restoration cost obligations and for recovering or financing its storm-related
costs. Storm cost recovery or financing will be subject to review by
applicable regulatory authorities.

  

In October 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC seeking
approval of certain ratemaking adjustments to facilitate issuance of shorter-
term bonds to provide interim financing for restoration costs associated with
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta. Subsequently, Entergy
Louisiana and the LPSC staff

filed a joint motion seeking approval to exclude from the derivation of
Entergy Louisiana’s capital structure and cost rate of debt for ratemaking
purposes, including the allowance for funds used during construction, shorter-
term debt up to $1.1 billion issued by Entergy Louisiana to fund costs
associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta costs on
an interim basis. In November 2020 the LPSC issued an order approving the
joint motion, and Entergy Louisiana issued $1.1 billion of 0.62% Series
mortgage bonds due November 2023.

  

In December 2020, Entergy Louisiana provided the LPSC with notification that
it intends to initiate a storm cost recovery proceeding in the near future,
which will permit the LPSC to retain any outside consultants and counsel
needed to review the storm cost recovery application. In February 2021 the
LPSC voted to retain outside counsel and consultants to assist in the review
of Entergy Louisiana’s upcoming storm cost recovery application, which is
expected to be filed in March 2021.

(a)Offset by related asset.

(b)As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December
2017, and the lowering of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to
21% effective January 2018, the Vidalia purchased power agreement regulatory
liability was reduced by $30.5 million and the Louisiana Act 55 financing
savings obligation regulatory liabilities were reduced by $25 million, with
corresponding increases to Other regulatory credits on the income statement.
The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are discussed further in Note 3 to
the financial statements.

  

Regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

  

See the “Other Tax Matters \- Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” section in Note 3 to the
financial statements for discussion of the effects of the December 2017
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including its effects on Entergy’s and
the Registrant Subsidiaries’ regulatory asset/liability for income taxes.

  

Entergy Arkansas

  

Consistent with its previously stated intent to return unprotected excess
accumulated deferred income taxes to customers as expeditiously as possible,
Entergy Arkansas initiated a tariff proceeding in February 2018 proposing to
establish a tax adjustment rider to provide retail customers with certain tax
benefits of $467 million associated with the Tax Act. For the residential
customer class, unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes were
returned to customers over a 21-month period from April 2018 through December
2019. For all other customer classes, unprotected excess accumulated deferred
income taxes were returned to customers over a nine-month period from April
2018 through December 2018. A true-up provision also was included in the
rider, with any over- or under-returned unprotected excess accumulated
deferred income taxes credited or billed to customers during the billing month
of January 2020, with any residual amounts of over- or under-returned
unprotected excess

accumulated deferred income taxes to be flowed through Entergy Arkansas’s
energy cost recovery rider. In March 2018 the APSC approved the tax adjustment
rider effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018.

  

As discussed below, in July 2018, Entergy Arkansas made its formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year. A hearing was held
in May 2018 regarding the APSC’s inquiries into the effects of the Tax Act,
including Entergy Arkansas’s proposal to utilize its formula rate plan rider
for its customers to realize the remaining benefits of the Tax Act. Entergy
Arkansas’s formula rate plan rider included a netting adjustment that compared
actual annual results to the allowed rate of return on common equity. In July
2018 the APSC issued an order agreeing with Entergy Arkansas’s proposal to
have the effects of the Tax Act on current income tax expense flow through
Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan rider and with Entergy Arkansas’s
treatment of protected and unprotected excess accumulated deferred income
taxes. The APSC also directed Entergy Arkansas to submit in the tax adjustment
rider proceeding, discussed above, the adjustments to all other riders
affected by the Tax Act and to include an amendment for a true up mechanism
where a rider affected by the Tax Act does not already contain a true-up
mechanism. Pursuant to a 2018 settlement agreement in Entergy Arkansas’s
formula rate plan proceeding, Entergy Arkansas also removed the net operating
loss accumulated deferred income tax asset caused by the Tax Act from Entergy
Arkansas’s tax adjustment rider. Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff filings
were accepted by the APSC in October 2018. In February 2021, pursuant to its
2020 formula rate plan evaluation report settlement, Entergy Arkansas flowed
$5.6 million in credits to customers through the tax adjustment rider based on
the outcome of certain federal tax positions and a decrease in the state tax
rate; the tax adjustment rider will be closed after the credits are issued.

  

Entergy Louisiana

  

In an electric formula rate plan settlement approved by the LPSC in April 2018
the parties agreed that Entergy Louisiana would return to customers one-half
of its eligible unprotected excess deferred income taxes from May 2018 through
December 2018 and return to customers the other half from January 2019 through
August 2022. In addition, the settlement provided that in order to flow back
to customers certain other tax benefits created by the Tax Act, Entergy
Louisiana established a regulatory liability effective January 1, 2018 in the
amount of $9.1 million per month to reflect these tax benefits already
included in retail rates until new base rates under the formula rate plan were
established in September 2018, and this regulatory liability was returned to
customers over the September 2018 through August 2019 formula rate plan rate-
effective period. The LPSC staff and intervenors in the settlement reserved
the right to obtain data from Entergy Louisiana to confirm the determination
of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Act and the
analysis thereof as part of the formula rate plan review proceeding for the
2017 test year filing which, as discussed below, Entergy Louisiana filed in
June 2018.

  

Entergy Mississippi

  

Entergy Mississippi filed its 2018 formula rate plan in March 2018 and
included a proposal to return all of its unprotected excess accumulated
deferred income taxes to customers through rates or in exchange for other
assets, or a combination of both, by the end of 2018. In June 2018 the MPSC
approved a stipulation filed by Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff in Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan filing that
addressed Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 formula rate plan evaluation report and
the ratemaking effects of the Tax Act. The stipulation provided for
incorporating the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate through
Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan. The stipulation approved in June 2018
provided for the flow-back of protected excess accumulated deferred income
taxes over the remaining lives of the assets through the formula rate plan.
The stipulation also provided for the offset of unprotected excess accumulated
deferred income taxes of $127.2 million against net utility plant and $2.2
million against other regulatory assets, and the return to customers of the
remaining balance of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes as
recovery of a portion of fuel oil inventory and customer bill credits over a
three-month period from July 2018 through September 2018, with an
insignificant true-up reflected in the November 2018 power management rider
filing. Entergy Mississippi recorded the reduction against net utility plant
and other regulatory assets in June 2018. In third quarter 2018, Entergy
Mississippi returned

unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes of $25.8 million through
customer bill credits and $5.8 million through the sale of fuel oil inventory.

  

Entergy New Orleans

  

After enactment of the Tax Act the City Council passed a resolution ordering
Entergy New Orleans to, effective January 1, 2018, record deferred regulatory
liabilities to account for the Tax Act’s effect on Entergy New Orleans’s
revenue requirement and to make a filing by mid-March 2018 regarding the Tax
Act’s effects on Entergy New Orleans’s operating income and rate base and
potential mechanisms for customers to receive benefits of the Tax Act. The
City Council’s resolution also directed Entergy New Orleans to request that
Entergy Services file with the FERC for revisions of the Unit Power Sales
Agreement and MSS-4 replacement tariffs to address the return of excess
accumulated deferred income taxes. Entergy submitted filings of this type to
the FERC.

  

In March 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the resolution
stating that the Tax Act reduced income tax expense from what was then
reflected in rates by approximately $8.2 million annually for electric
operations and by approximately $1.3 million annually for gas operations. In
the filing, Entergy New Orleans proposed to return to customers from June 2018
through August 2019 the benefits of the reduction in income tax expense and
its unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a combination
of bill credits and investments in energy efficiency programs, grid
modernization, and Smart City projects. Entergy New Orleans submitted
supplemental information in April 2018 and May 2018. Shortly thereafter,
Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s advisors reached an agreement in
principle that provides for benefits that will be realized by Entergy New
Orleans customers through bill credits that started in July 2018 and offsets
to future investments in energy efficiency programs, grid modernization, and
Smart City projects, as well as additional benefits related to the filings
made at the FERC. The agreement in principle was approved by the City Council
in June 2018.

  

Entergy Texas

  

After enactment of the Tax Act the PUCT issued an order requiring most
utilities, including Entergy Texas, beginning January 25, 2018, to record a
regulatory liability for the difference between revenues collected under
existing rates and revenues that would have been collected had existing rates
been set using the new federal income tax rates and also for the balance of
excess accumulated deferred income taxes. Entergy Texas had previously
provided information to the PUCT staff and stated that it expected the PUCT to
address the lower tax expense as part of Entergy Texas’s rate case expected to
be filed in May 2018.

  

In May 2018, Entergy Texas filed its 2018 base rate case with the PUCT.
Entergy Texas’s proposed rates and revenues reflected the inclusion of the
federal income tax reductions due to the Tax Act. The PUCT issued an order in
December 2018 establishing that 1) $25 million be credited to customers
through a rider to reflect the lower federal income tax rate applicable to
Entergy Texas from January 2018 through the date new rates were implemented,
2) $242.5 million of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes be
returned to customers through base rates under the average rate assumption
method over the lives of the associated assets, and 3) $185.2 million of
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes be returned to customers
through a rider. The unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes
rider includes carrying charges and is in effect over a period of 12 months
for larger customers and over a period of four years for other customers.

  

System Energy

  

In a filing made with the FERC in March 2018, System Energy proposed revisions
to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to reflect the effects of the Tax Act. In
the filing System Energy proposed to return identified quantities of
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to its customers by the
end of 2018. In May 2018 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed tax
revisions with an effective date of June 1, 2018, subject to refund and the
outcome of settlement and hearing procedures. Settlement discussions were
terminated in April 2019, and a hearing was held in March 2020. The retail
regulators of the Utility operating companies that are parties to the Unit

Power Sales Agreement challenged the treatment and amount of excess
accumulated deferred income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions related to nuclear decommissioning. In July 2020 the presiding ALJ
in the proceeding issued an initial decision finding that there is an
additional $147 million in unprotected excess accumulated deferred income
taxes related to System Energy’s uncertain decommissioning tax deduction. The
initial decision determined that System Energy should have included the $147
million in its March 2018 filing. System Energy had not included credits
related to the effect of the Tax Act on the uncertain decommissioning tax
position because it was uncertain whether the IRS would allow the deduction.
The initial decision rejected both System Energy’s alternative argument that
any crediting should occur over a ten-year period and the retail regulators’
argument that any crediting should occur over a two-year period. Instead, the
initial decision concluded that System Energy should credit the additional
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes in a single lump sum
revenue requirement reduction following a FERC order addressing the initial
decision.

  

The ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process. In
September 2020, System Energy filed a brief on exceptions with the FERC, re-
urging its positions and requesting the reversal of the ALJ’s initial
decision. In December 2020, the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, City Council, and FERC trial
staff filed briefs opposing exceptions. The FERC will review the case and
issue an order in the proceeding, and the FERC may accept, reject, or modify
the ALJ’s initial decision in whole or in part. Credits, if any, that might be
required will only become due after the FERC issues its order reviewing the
initial decision.

  

As discussed below in “Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and
Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue,” in September 2020 the IRS issued a
Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) and Entergy executed it. In September
2020, System Energy filed a motion to lodge the NOPA into the record in the
FERC proceeding. In October 2020 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, City Council, and FERC
trial staff filed oppositions to System Energy’s motion. As a result of the
NOPA, System Energy filed, in October 2020, a new Federal Power Act section
205 filing at the FERC to credit the excess accumulated deferred income taxes
resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax position. System Energy
proposes to credit the entire amount of the excess accumulated deferred income
taxes arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax
position by issuing a one-time credit of $17.8 million. In November 2020, the
LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the filing, and System
Energy responded.

  

In November 2020 the IRS issued the Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for the
2014-2015 tax years and in December 2020 Entergy executed it. In December
2020, System Energy filed a motion to lodge the RAR into the record in the
FERC proceeding addressing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In January 2021 the
LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a joint answer opposing System
Energy’s motion, and the FERC trial staff also filed an answer opposing System
Energy’s motion.

  

As a result of the RAR, in December 2020, System Energy also filed an
amendment to its Federal Power Act section 205 filing to credit excess
accumulated deferred income taxes arising from the successful portion of the
decommissioning uncertain tax position. The amendment proposed the inclusion
of the RAR as support for the filing. In December 2020, the LPSC, APSC, and
City Council filed a protest in response to the amendment, reiterating
objections to the filing to credit excess accumulated deferred income taxes
arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax
position. In February 2021 the FERC issued an order accepting System Energy’s
Federal Power Act section 205 filing subject to refund, setting it for
hearing, and holding the hearing in abeyance.

  

In November 2020, System Energy filed a motion to vacate the ALJ’s decision,
arguing that it had been overtaken by changed circumstances because of the
IRS’s determination resulting from the NOPA and RAR. In January 2021 the LPSC,
APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a joint answer opposing System Energy’s
motion, and the FERC trial staff also filed an answer opposing System Energy’s
motion. There is no formal deadline for FERC to rule on the motion.

Fuel and purchased power cost recovery

  

The Utility operating companies are allowed to recover fuel and purchased
power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric and gas rates that
are recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues
collected and the current fuel and purchased power costs is generally recorded
as “Deferred fuel costs” on the Utility operating companies’ financial
statements. The table below shows the amount of deferred fuel costs as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019 that Entergy expects to recover (or return to
customers) through fuel mechanisms, subject to subsequent regulatory review.

period greater than twelve months.

  

Entergy Arkansas

  

Energy Cost Recovery Rider

  

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to
recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. The rider
utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for
the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an
energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up
adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges,
of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery
rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of
over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.

  

In January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its
upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014.
In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy
Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate
$65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in
2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident. Entergy Arkansas requested that
the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel
balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information
was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator
incident. In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to
retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance. In July 2017, Entergy
Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.
In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by
the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate
a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld
from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of
deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to certain
timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement. See the “ANO
Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews” section in Note 8 to the financial statements
for further discussion of the ANO stator incident.

In March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an
increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kWh to $0.01547 per kWh. The APSC staff
filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be
implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal
operation of the tariff. Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect
on March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff. In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney
General requested additional information to support certain of the costs
included in Entergy Arkansas’s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination.

  

In March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an
increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kWh to $0.01882 per kWh. The Arkansas
Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual redetermination
filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the
amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to
refund. Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were
questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential
implications of the Tax Act. Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney
General’s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining
to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider,
those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. Entergy
Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Act are appropriately
considered in the APSC’s separate proceeding regarding potential implications
of the tax law. The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General’s
filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas’s filing complied with the terms of
the energy cost recovery rider. The redetermined rate became effective with
the first billing cycle of April 2018. Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC
issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery
rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the
issues suggested by the Attorney General in the proceeding. Following a period
of discovery, the Attorney General filed a supplemental response in October
2018 raising new issues with Entergy Arkansas’s March 2018 rate
redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of the increase should be
collected subject to refund pending further investigation. Entergy Arkansas
filed to dismiss the Attorney General’s supplemental response, the APSC
general staff filed a motion to strike the Attorney General’s filing, and the
Attorney General filed a supplemental response disputing Entergy Arkansas and
the APSC staff’s filing. Applicable APSC rules and processes authorize its
general staff to initiate periodic audits of Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost
recovery rider. In late-2018 the APSC general staff notified Entergy Arkansas
it has initiated an audit of the 2017 fuel costs. The time in which the audit
will be complete is uncertain at this time.

  

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a
decrease from $0.01882 per kWh to $0.01462 per kWh and became effective with
the first billing cycle in April 2019. In March 2019 the Arkansas Attorney
General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual adjustment and included
with its filing a motion for investigation of alleged overcharges to customers
in connection with the FERC’s October 2018 order in the opportunity sales
proceeding. Entergy Arkansas filed its response to the Attorney General’s
motion in April 2019 in which Entergy Arkansas stated its intent to initiate a
proceeding to address recovery issues related to the October 2018 FERC order.
In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas initiated the opportunity sales recovery
proceeding, discussed below, and requested that the APSC establish that
proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may
assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC
October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales
proceeding. In June 2019 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s request and also
denied the Attorney General’s motion in the energy cost recovery proceeding
seeking an investigation into Entergy Arkansas’s annual energy cost recovery
rider adjustment and referred the evaluation of such matters to the
opportunity sales recovery proceeding.

  

In March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a
decrease from $0.01462 per kWh to $0.01052 per kWh. The redetermined rate
became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2020 through the normal
operation of the tariff.

Entergy Louisiana

  

Entergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the
billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to
the billing month. Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include
estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises
from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues
billed to customers, including carrying charges.

  

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of the fuel
adjustment clause filings by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, whose business was
combined with Entergy Louisiana in 2015. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel
adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. In January 2019 the
LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff
consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $900,000,
plus interest, to customers based upon the imputation of a claim of vendor
fault in servicing its nuclear plant. Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision
in the first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit. In August
2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the
LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation
of replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is
appropriate. Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require no refund to
customers.

  

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Louisiana through its fuel
adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. In January 2019 the
LPSC staff issued its audit report recommending that Entergy Louisiana refund
approximately $7.3 million, plus interest, to customers based upon the
imputation of a claim of vendor fault in servicing its nuclear plant. Entergy
Louisiana recorded a provision in the first quarter 2019 for the potential
outcome of the audit. In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony
challenging the basis for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and
providing an alternative calculation of replacement power costs should it be
determined that a disallowance is appropriate. Entergy Louisiana’s calculation
would require a refund to customers of approximately $4.3 million, plus
interest, as compared to the LPSC staff’s recommendation of $7.3 million, plus
interest. Responsive testimony was filed by the LPSC staff and intervenors in
September 2019; all parties either agreed with or did not oppose Entergy
Louisiana’s alternative calculation of replacement power costs.

  

In November 2019 the pending LPSC proceedings for the 2010-2013 Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana audits were consolidated to
facilitate a settlement of both fuel audits. In December 2019 an unopposed
settlement was reached that requires a refund to legacy Entergy Louisiana
customers of approximately $2.3 million, including interest, and no refund to
legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers. The LPSC approved the
settlement in January 2020. A one-time refund was made in February 2020.

  

In June 2016 the LPSC issued notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel
adjustment clause filings for the period 2014 through 2015 and purchased gas
adjustment clause filings for the period 2012 through 2015. In recognition of
the business combination that occurred in 2015, the audit notice was issued to
Entergy Louisiana and also includes a review of charges to legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana customers prior to the business combination. The audits
include a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2014 through 2015 and
charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause for
the period from 2012 through 2015. Regarding the fuel adjustment clause
filing, the LPSC staff issued a report in January 2021 that did not recommend
a disallowance for the period 2014 through 2015 recoveries, but did propose
various reporting requirements. Entergy Louisiana is currently reviewing the
LPSC staff recommendations regarding reporting requirements. Regarding the
purchased gas adjustment clause filings, the LPSC staff issued a report in
February 2020 that did not recommend a disallowance for the period 2012
through 2015 recoveries. The LPSC issued an order in September 2020 accepting
the LPSC staff’s report.

  

In May 2018 the LPSC staff provided notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s
purchased gas adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s

purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2016 through 2017. In
February 2020 the LPSC staff issued an audit report recommending a
disallowance of approximately $29 thousand. Entergy Louisiana submitted a
letter disputing the basis of the proposed disallowance but indicated that due
to the amount at issue it would not oppose the recommended refund. The LPSC
staff and Entergy Louisiana submitted a joint report noting each party’s
position on the substantive issues in the matter and recommending resolution
of the matters. The LPSC issued an order in September 2020 resolving the
matter and ordering a refund of approximately $29 thousand. In January 2021
the LPSC issued a notice closing the matter.

  

In March 2020 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment
clause for the period from 2016 through 2019. Discovery commenced in September
2020 and is ongoing.

  

Entergy Mississippi

  

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider
that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries.
Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits
conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

  

In January 2017 the MPSC certified to the Mississippi Legislature the audit
reports of its independent auditors for the fuel year ending September 30,
2016. In November 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff separately
engaged a consultant to review the September 2016 outage at the Grand Gulf
Nuclear Station and to review ongoing operations at Grand Gulf. This
engagement continues, and subsequently, was expanded to include all outages at
Grand Gulf that occurred through 2019.

  

In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately
$61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills.

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately
$57 million as of September 30, 2018. In January 2019 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2019 bills.

  

In November 2019, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation included $39.6 million of prior over-recovery flowing back to
customers beginning February 2020. Entergy Mississippi’s balance in its
deferred fuel account did not decrease as expected after implementation of the
new factor. In an effort to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, in
May 2020, Entergy Mississippi requested an interim adjustment to the energy
cost recovery rider to credit approximately $50 million from the over-
recovered balance in the deferred fuel account to customers over four
consecutive billing months. The MPSC approved this interim adjustment in May
2020 effective for June through September 2020 bills.

  

In November 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of approximately
$24.4 million as of September 30, 2020. In January 2021 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2021 bills.

Entergy Texas

  

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and
purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates. Semi-
annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September
based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts
collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or
refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. A fuel
reconciliation is required to be filed at least once every three years and
outside of a base rate case filing.

  

In December 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of
approximately $30.5 million for the months of May 2017 through October 2017.
Also in December 2017, the PUCT’s ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis.
For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills from January 2018 through
March 2018. The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in March 2018.

  

In September 2019, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel
and purchased power costs for the period from April 2016 through March 2019.
During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.6
billion in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses,
net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.
Entergy Texas estimated an under-recovery balance of approximately $25.8
million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry
over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period
beginning April 2019. In March 2020 an intervenor filed testimony proposing
that the PUCT disallow: (1) $2 million in replacement power costs associated
with generation outages during the reconciliation period; and (2) $24.4
million associated with the operation of the Spindletop natural gas storage
facility during the reconciliation period. In April 2020, Entergy Texas filed
rebuttal testimony refuting all points raised by the intervenor. In June 2020
the parties filed a stipulation and settlement agreement, which included a
$1.2 million disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised by
any party. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2020.

  

In July 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an
interim fuel refund of $25.5 million, including interest. Entergy Texas
proposes that the interim fuel refund be implemented beginning with the first
August 2020 billing cycle over a three-month period for smaller customers and
in a lump sum amount in the billing month of August 2020 for transmission-
level customers. The interim fuel refund was approved in July 2020, and
Entergy Texas began refunds in August 2020.

  

In February 2021, Entergy Texas filed an application to implement a fuel
refund for a cumulative over-recovery of approximately $75 million that is
primarily attributable to settlements received by Entergy Texas from MISO
related to Hurricane Laura. Entergy Texas planned to issue the refund over the
period of March through August 2021. On February 22, 2021, Entergy Texas filed
a motion to abate its fuel refund proceeding to assess how the February 2021
winter storm impacted Entergy Texas’s fuel over-recovery position.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2018 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year. The filing showed
Entergy Arkansas’s projected earned return on common equity for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 test period to be below the formula rate plan
bandwidth. Additionally, the filing included the first netting adjustment
under the current formula rate plan for the historical test year 2017,
reflecting the change in formula rate plan revenues associated with actual
2017 results when compared to the allowed rate of return on equity. The filing
included a projected $73.4 million revenue deficiency for 2019 and a $95.6
million revenue deficiency for the 2017 historical test year, for a total
revenue requirement of $169 million for this filing. By operation of the
formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is
subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy
Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the
resulting increase was limited to four percent of total revenue, which
originally was $65.4 million but was increased to $66.7 million based upon the
APSC staff’s updated calculation of 2018 revenue. In October 2018, Entergy
Arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed joint motions to approve a
partial settlement agreement as to certain factual issues and agreed to brief
contested legal issues. In November 2018 the APSC held a hearing and was
briefed on a contested legal issue. In December 2018 the APSC issued a
decision related to the initial legal brief, approved the partial settlement
agreement and $66.7 million revenue requirement increase, as well as Entergy
Arkansas’s formula rate plan, with updated rates going into effect for the
first billing cycle of January 2019.

  

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2019 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2020 calendar year. The filing
contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year
2020 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2018. The total proposed
formula rate plan rider revenue change designed to produce a target rate of
return on common equity of 9.75% is $15.3 million, which is based upon a
deficiency of approximately $61.9 million for the 2020 projected year, netted
with a credit of approximately $46.6 million in the 2018 historical year
netting adjustment. During 2018 Entergy Arkansas experienced higher-than
expected sales volume, and actual costs were lower than forecasted. These
changes, coupled with a reduced income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, resulted in the credit for the historical year netting
adjustment. In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Arkansas recorded a provision
of $35.1 million that reflected the estimate of the historical year netting
adjustment that was expected to be included in the 2019 filing. In 2019,
Entergy Arkansas recorded additional provisions totaling $11.5 million to
reflect the updated estimate of the historical year netting adjustment
included in the 2019 filing. In October 2019 other parties in the proceeding
filed their errors and objections requesting certain adjustments to Entergy
Arkansas’s filing that would reduce or eliminate Entergy Arkansas’s proposed
revenue change. Entergy Arkansas filed its response addressing the requested
adjustments in October 2019. In its response, Entergy Arkansas accepted
certain of the adjustments recommended by the General Staff of the APSC that
would reduce the proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change to $14
million. Entergy Arkansas disputed the remaining adjustments proposed by the
parties. In October 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement
agreement with the other parties in the proceeding seeking APSC approval of a
revised total formula rate plan rider revenue change of $10.1 million. In its
July 2019 formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas proposed to recover an
$11.2 million regulatory asset, amortized over five years, associated with
specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White
Bluff plant. Although Entergy Arkansas does not concede that the regulatory
asset lacks merit, for purposes of reaching a settlement on the total formula
rate plan rider amount, Entergy Arkansas agreed not to include the White Bluff
scrubber regulatory asset cost in the 2019 formula rate plan filing or future
filings. Entergy Arkansas recorded a write-off in 2019 of the $11.2 million
White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset. In December 2019 the APSC approved the
settlement as being

in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff
effective with the first billing cycle of January 2020.

  

2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2020 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2021 calendar year. The filing
contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year
2021, as amended through subsequent filings in the proceeding, and a netting
adjustment for the historical year 2019. The filing showed that Entergy
Arkansas’s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2021 projected year
is 8.22% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $64.3 million. The earned rate
of return on common equity for the 2019 historical year was 9.07% resulting in
a $23.9 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the
2021 projected year and 2019 historical year netting adjustment was $88.2
million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of
the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue
constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing
exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $74.3 million.
In October 2020 other parties in the proceeding filed their errors and
objections recommending certain adjustments, and Entergy Arkansas filed
responsive testimony disputing these adjustments. As part of the formula rate
plan tariff the calculation for the revenue constraint was updated based on
actual revenues which had the effect of reducing the initially-proposed $74.3
million revenue requirement increase to $72.6 million. In October 2020,
Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a unanimous settlement agreement reached
with the other parties that resolved all but one issue. As a result of the
settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas’s requested revenue increase was $68.4
million, including a $44.5 million increase for the projected 2021 year and a
$23.9 million netting adjustment. The remaining issue litigated concerned the
methodology used to calculate the netting adjustment within the formula rate
plan. In December 2020 the APSC issued an order rejecting the netting
adjustment method used by Entergy Arkansas. Applying the approach ordered by
the APSC changed the netting adjustment for the 2019 historical year from a
$23.9 million deficiency to $43.5 million excess. Overall, the decision
reduced Entergy Arkansas’s revenue adjustment for 2021 to $1 million. In
December 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition for rehearing of the APSC’s
decision, and in January 2021 the APSC granted further consideration of
Entergy Arkansas’s petition. Based on the progress of the proceeding to date,
in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory liability of $43.5
million to reflect the netting adjustment for 2019, as included in the APSC’s
December 2020 order, which would be returned to customers in 2021. Also with
the formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas is requesting an extension of
the formula rate plan rider for a second five-year term. Decisions by the APSC
on the netting adjustment rehearing and the extension are expected in March
2021.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In April 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the APSC issued an order
requiring utilities, to the extent they had not already done so, to suspend
service disconnections during the remaining pendency of the Arkansas
Governor’s emergency declaration or until the APSC rescinds the directive. The
order also authorizes utilities to establish a regulatory asset to record
costs resulting from the suspension of service disconnections, directs that in
future proceedings the APSC will consider whether the request for recovery of
these regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, and requires utilities to
track and report the costs and any savings directly attributable to suspension
of disconnects. In May 2020 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas expanding
deferred payment agreements to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Quarterly reporting began in August 2020 and the APSC ordered additional
reporting in October 2020 regarding utilities’ transitional plans for ending
the moratorium on service disconnects. In February 2021 the APSC issued an
order finding that it is not in the public interest to immediately lift the
moratorium on service disconnects, but to announce a target date of May 3,
2021. In March 2021 the APSC will issue an order either confirming the lifting
of the moratorium on service disconnects or extending the moratorium. As of
December 31, 2020, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory asset of $10.5
million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Internal Restructuring

  

In November 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed an application with the APSC seeking
authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer
of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Arkansas to a new
entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary
holding company. In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed a settlement, reached by
all parties in the APSC proceeding, resolving all issues. The APSC approved
the settlement agreement and restructuring in August 2018. Pursuant to the
settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas will credit retail customers $39.6
million over six years, beginning in 2019. Entergy Arkansas also received the
required FERC and NRC approvals.

In November 2018, Entergy Arkansas undertook a multi-step restructuring,
including the following:

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at the
aggregate redemption price of approximately $32.7 million.

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. converted from an Arkansas corporation to a Texas
corporation.

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy
Arkansas Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Arkansas
Power), and Entergy Arkansas Power assumed substantially all of the
liabilities of Entergy Arkansas, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger
under the TXBOC. Entergy Arkansas, Inc. remained in existence and held the
membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power.

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy
Arkansas Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation). As a result
of the contribution, Entergy Arkansas Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

  

In December 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility
Property, Inc., and Entergy Arkansas Power then changed its name to Entergy
Arkansas, LLC. Entergy Arkansas, LLC holds substantially all of the assets,
and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under
common control.

2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In June 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report
for its 2017 calendar year operations. The 2017 test year evaluation report
produced an earned return on equity of 8.16%, due in large part to revenue-
neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms. Without these realignments,
the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of 9.88% and a
resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of $4.8 million.
Excluding the Tax Act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment
mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total
of $98 million as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the
additional capacity and MISO cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate
plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism. In August
2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan evaluation
report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan
proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect
lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses
to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement. Based on the August 2018
update, Entergy Louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan
revenue of approximately $17.6 million. Results of the updated 2017 evaluation
report filing were implemented with the September 2018 billing month subject
to refund and review by the LPSC staff and intervenors. In accordance with the
terms of the formula rate plan, in September 2018 the LPSC staff and
intervenors submitted their responses to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula
rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates. The LPSC
staff asserted objections/reservations

regarding 1) Entergy Louisiana’s proposed rate adjustments associated with the
return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Act and
the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of
rate base; 2) Entergy Louisiana’s reservation regarding treatment of a
regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC; and 3) test
year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana. Intervenors
also objected to Entergy Louisiana’s treatment of the regulatory asset related
to certain special orders by the LPSC. A procedural schedule has not yet been
established to resolve these issues.

  

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial
proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be
accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of
other customer classes.

  

Commercial operation at J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles
Power Station) commenced in May 2019. In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed an
update to its 2017 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the
estimated first-year revenue requirement of $109.5 million associated with the
J. Wayne Leonard Power Station. The resulting interim adjustment to rates
became effective with the first billing cycle of June 2019.  In June 2020,
Entergy Louisiana submitted information to the LPSC to review the prudence of
Entergy Louisiana’s management of the project. In August 2020 discovery
commenced and a procedural schedule was established with a hearing in July
2021.

  

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report
for its 2018 calendar year operations. The 2018 test year evaluation report
produced an earned return on common equity of 10.61% leading to a base rider
formula rate plan revenue decrease of $8.9 million. While base rider formula
rate plan revenue will decrease as a result of this filing, overall formula
rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $118.7 million. This outcome
is primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through
the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission
recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity
mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items. The filing is
subject to review by the LPSC. Resulting rates were implemented in September
2019, subject to refund.

  

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial
proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be
accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of
other customer classes. Entergy Louisiana contemplates that any combination of
residential rates resulting from this request would be implemented with the
results of the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing.

  

Several parties intervened in the proceeding and the LPSC staff filed its
report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the formula rate plan. In its report the LPSC staff re-urged reservations
with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate
plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test
years 2017 and 2018. The LPSC staff objected to Entergy Louisiana’s proposal
to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference
to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue. The LPSC
staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of Willow
Glen reflected in the evaluation report and to the August 2019 compliance
update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in
the formula rate plan’s transmission recovery mechanism, based on limited time
to review it. Additionally, since the completion of certain transmission
projects, the LPSC staff issued supplemental data requests addressing the
prudence of Entergy Louisiana’s expenditures in connection with those
projects. Entergy Louisiana has responded to all such requests.

  

Commercial operation at Lake Charles Power Station commenced in March 2020. In
March 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2018 formula rate plan
evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of
$108 million associated with the Lake Charles Power Station. The resulting
interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of
April 2020.

In an effort to narrow the remaining issues in formula rate plan test years
2017 and 2018, Entergy Louisiana provided notice to the parties in October
2020 that it was withdrawing its request to combine residential rates. Entergy
Louisiana noted that the withdrawal is without prejudice to Entergy
Louisiana’s right to seek to combine residential rates in a future proceeding.

  

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its formula rate plan
evaluation report for its 2019 calendar year operations. The 2019 test year
evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 9.66%. As
such, no change to base rider formula rate plan revenue is required. Although
base rider formula rate plan revenue will not change as a result of this
filing, overall formula rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $103
million. This outcome is driven by the removal of prior year credits
associated with the sale of the Willow Glen Power Station and an increase in
the transmission recovery mechanism. Also contributing to the overall change
is an increase in legacy formula rate plan revenue requirements driven by
legacy Entergy Louisiana capacity cost true-ups and higher annualized legacy
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana revenues due to higher billing determinants,
offset by reductions in MISO cost recovery mechanism and tax reform adjustment
mechanism revenue requirements. In August 2020 the LPSC staff submitted a list
of items for which it needs additional information to confirm the accuracy and
compliance of the 2019 test year evaluation report. The LPSC staff objected to
a proposed revenue neutral adjustment regarding a certain rider as being
beyond the scope of permitted formula rate plan adjustments. Rates reflected
in the May 2020 filing, with the exception of the revenue neutral rider
adjustment, and as updated in an August 2020 filing, were implemented in
September 2020, subject to refund. Entergy Louisiana is in the process of
providing additional information and details on the May 2020 filing as
requested by the LPSC staff.

  

In November 2020, Entergy Louisiana accepted ownership of the Washington
Parish Energy Center and filed an update to its 2019 formula rate plan
evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of
$35 million associated with the Washington Parish Energy Center. The resulting
interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of
December 2020. In January 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2019
formula rate plan evaluation report to include the implementation of a
scheduled step-up in its nuclear decommissioning revenue requirement and a
true-up for under-collections of nuclear decommissioning expenses. The total
rate adjustment would increase formula rate plan revenues by approximately
$1.2 million. The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with
the first billing cycle of February 2021.

  

Request for Extension and Modification of Formula Rate Plan

  

In May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its application for
authority to extend its formula rate plan. In its application, Entergy
Louisiana seeks to maintain a 9.8% return on equity, with a bandwidth of 60
basis points above and below the midpoint, with a first-year midpoint reset.
Entergy Louisiana also seeks to maintain its existing additional capacity
mechanism, tax reform adjustment mechanism, transmission recovery mechanism,
and the MISO cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Louisiana also seeks to add a
distribution cost recovery mechanism which operates in substantially the same
manner as the transmission recovery mechanism, seeks to utilize end of period
rate base to calculate cost of service, and requests a deferral of certain
expenses incurred for outside of right-of-way vegetation programs. Settlement
discussions are ongoing.

  

Investigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services

  

In November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an
investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the
retail rates of Entergy Louisiana. As stated in the notice of proceeding, the
LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by
Entergy Services. Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly
detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the
audit. There has been no further activity in the investigation since May 2019.

COVID-19 Orders

  

In April 2020 the LPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to record as a
regulatory asset expenses incurred from the suspension of disconnections and
collection of late fees imposed by LPSC orders associated with the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, utilities may seek future recovery, subject to LPSC
review and approval, of losses and expenses incurred due to compliance with
the LPSC’s COVID-19 orders. The suspension of late fees and disconnects for
non-pay was extended until the first billing cycle after July 16, 2020. In
January 2021, Entergy Louisiana resumed disconnections for customers in all
customer classes with past-due balances that have not made payment
arrangements. Utilities seeking to recover the regulatory asset must formally
petition the LPSC to do so, identifying the direct and indirect costs for
which recovery is sought. Any such request is subject to LPSC review and
approval. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Louisiana recorded a regulatory
asset of $48.8 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2018 test
year filing and 2017 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return for the historical 2017 calendar year and projected earned return for
the 2018 calendar year, in large part as a result of the lower federal
corporate income tax rate effective in 2018, to be within the formula rate
plan bandwidth, resulting in no change in rates. In June 2018, Entergy
Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a
stipulation that confirmed that Entergy Mississippi’s earned returns for both
the 2017 look-back filing and 2018 test year were within the respective
formula rate plan bandwidths. In June 2018 the MPSC approved the stipulation,
which resulted in no change in rates. See “Regulatory activity regarding the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” above for additional discussion regarding the treatment
of the effects of the lower federal corporate income tax rate.

  

Formula Rate Plan Revisions

  

In October 2018, Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate
plan that would provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim
capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of
additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the non-
fuel annual ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating Station, as well as to
allow similar cost recovery treatment for other future capacity acquisitions,
such as the Sunflower Solar Facility, that are approved by the MPSC. In
December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to
its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment
mechanism to recover the $59 million first-year annual revenue requirement
associated with the non-fuel ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating
Station, which Entergy Mississippi began billing in January 2020. The MPSC
must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each
new resource. In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate
plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments
effective April 1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or
credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order. The MPSC also authorized
Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula
rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation
management rider. Effective with the April 2020 billing cycle, Entergy
Mississippi implemented a rider to recover $22 million in vegetation
management costs.

  

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In March 2019, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2019 test
year filing and 2018 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return for the historical 2018 calendar year to be above the

formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2019 calendar
year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2019 test year filing
shows a $36.8 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy
Mississippi’s earned return on common equity to the specified point of
adjustment of 6.94% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan
bandwidth. The 2018 look-back filing compares actual 2018 results to the
approved benchmark return on rate base and shows a $10.1 million interim
decrease in formula rate plan revenues is necessary. In the fourth quarter
2018, Entergy Mississippi recorded a provision of $9.3 million that reflected
the estimate of the difference between the 2018 expected earned rate of return
on rate base and an established performance-adjusted benchmark rate of return
under the formula rate plan performance-adjusted bandwidth mechanism. In the
first quarter 2019, Entergy Mississippi recorded a $0.8 million increase in
the provision to reflect the amount shown in the look-back filing. In June
2019, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered
into a joint stipulation that confirmed that the 2019 test year filing showed
that a $32.8 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s
earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.93%
return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. Additionally,
pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 look-back filing
reflected an earned return on rate base of 7.81% in calendar year 2018 which
is above the look-back benchmark return on rate base of 7.13%, resulting in an
$11 million decrease in formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through
May 2020. In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Mississippi recorded an
additional $0.9 million increase in the provision to reflect the $11 million
shown in the look-back filing. In June 2019 the MPSC approved the joint
stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2019.

In March 2020, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2020 test
year filing and 2019 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return for the historical 2019 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan
bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2020 calendar year to be below
the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2020 test year filing shows a $24.6
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.51% return
on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2019 look-back
filing compares actual 2019 results to the approved benchmark return on rate
base and reflects the need for a $7.3 million interim increase in formula rate
plan revenues. In accordance with the MPSC-approved revisions to the formula
rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $24.3 million interim rate
increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2019 retail revenues, effective with
the April 2020 billing cycle, subject to refund. In June 2020, Entergy
Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint
stipulation that confirmed that the 2020 test year filing showed that a $23.8
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.51% return
on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. Pursuant to the joint
stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2019 look-back filing reflected an earned
return on rate base of 6.75% in calendar year 2019, which is within the look-
back bandwidth. As a result, there is no change in formula rate plan revenues
in the 2019 look-back filing. In June 2020 the MPSC approved the joint
stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2020. In
the June 2020 order the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to submit revisions
to its formula rate plan to realign recovery of costs from its energy
efficiency cost recovery rider to its formula rate plan. In November 2020 the
MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s revisions to its formula rate plan
providing for the realignment of energy efficiency costs to its formula rate
plan, the deferral of energy efficiency expenditures into a regulatory asset,
and the elimination of its energy efficiency cost recovery rider effective
with the January 2022 billing cycle.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In March 2020 the MPSC issued an order suspending disconnections for a period
of sixty days. The MPSC extended the order on disconnections through May 26,
2020. In April 2020 the MPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to defer
incremental costs and expenses associated with COVID-19 compliance and to seek
future recovery through rates of the prudently incurred incremental costs and
expenses. In December 2020, Entergy Mississippi resumed disconnections to
commercial, industrial, and governmental customers with past-due balances that
have not made payment arrangements. In January 2021, Entergy Mississippi
resumed disconnecting service for residential

customers with past-due balances that have not made arrangements with the
company. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory
asset of $19.2 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Internal Restructuring

  

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC seeking
authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer
of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Mississippi to a
new entity, which would ultimately be held by an existing Entergy subsidiary
holding company. In September 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi
Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed a joint stipulation regarding
the restructuring filing. In September 2018 the MPSC issued an order accepting
the stipulation in its entirety and approving the restructuring and credits of
$27 million to retail customers over six years, consisting of annual payments
of $4.5 million for the years 2019-2024. Entergy Mississippi also received the
required FERC approval.

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi undertook a multi-step restructuring,
including the following:

  

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock, at the
aggregate redemption price of approximately $21.2 million.

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. converted from a Mississippi corporation to a Texas
corporation.

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Mississippi,
Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light), and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light assumed
substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Mississippi, Inc., in a
transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Mississippi, Inc.
remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi
Power and Light.

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company,
LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).
As a result of the contribution, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

  

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi, Inc. changed its name to Entergy
Utility Enterprises, Inc., and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light then
changed its name to Entergy Mississippi, LLC. Entergy Mississippi, LLC holds
substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the
liabilities, of Entergy Mississippi, Inc. The restructuring was accounted for
as a transaction between entities under common control.

  

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its notice of intent to implement
the restructuring credit rider to allow Entergy Mississippi to return credits
of $27 million to retail customers over six years. In January 2019 the MPSC
approved the proposed restructuring credit adjustment factor, which is
effective for bills rendered beginning February 2019.

  

Filings with the City Council (Entergy New Orleans)

  

Retail Rates

  

Energy Efficiency

  

In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City
Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the Energy Smart
program from April 2020 through December 2022. Entergy New Orleans proposed to
recover the costs of the program through mechanisms previously approved by the
City Council or through the energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which was
approved in the 2018 combined rate case resolution. In January 2020 the City
Council’s advisors recommended that, beginning with Program Year 10, the City
Council allow Entergy New Orleans to earn a utility performance incentive of
7% of Energy Smart costs for each year in

which Entergy New Orleans achieves 100% of the City Council’s savings targets
for Energy Smart. In February 2020 the City Council approved Entergy New
Orleans’s application.

  

2018 Base Rate Case

  

In September 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate
case with the City Council. The filing requested a 10.5% return on equity for
electric operations with opportunity to earn a 10.75% return on equity through
a performance adder provision of the electric formula rate plan in subsequent
years under a formula rate plan and requested a 10.75% return on equity for
gas operations. The proposed electric rates in the revised filing reflect a
net reduction of $20.3 million. The reduction in electric rates includes a
base rate increase of $135.2 million, of which $131.5 million is associated
with moving costs currently collected through fuel and other riders into base
rates, plus a request for an advanced metering surcharge to recover $7.1
million associated with advanced metering infrastructure, offset by a net
decrease of $31.1 million related to fuel and other riders. The filing also
included a proposed gas rate decrease of $142 thousand. Entergy New Orleans’s
rates reflected the inclusion of federal income tax reductions due to the Tax
Act and the provisions of a previously-approved agreement in principle
determining how the benefits of the Tax Act would flow. Entergy New Orleans
included cost of service studies for electric and gas operations for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the projected twelve months ending
December 31, 2018. In addition, Entergy New Orleans included capital additions
expected to be placed into service for the period through December 31, 2019.
Entergy New Orleans based its request for a change in rates on the projected
twelve months ending December 31, 2018.

  

The filing’s major provisions included: (1) a new electric rate structure,
which realigns the revenue requirement associated with capacity and long-term
service agreement expense from certain existing riders to base revenue,
provides for the recovery of the cost of advanced metering infrastructure, and
partially blends rates for Entergy New Orleans’s customers residing in Algiers
with customers residing in the remainder of Orleans Parish through a three-
year phase-in; (2) contemporaneous cost recovery riders for investments in
energy efficiency/demand response, incremental changes in capacity/long-term
service agreement costs, grid modernization investment, and gas infrastructure
replacement investment; and (3) formula rate plans for both electric and gas
operations. In February 2019 the City Council’s advisors and several
intervenors filed testimony in response to Entergy New Orleans’s application.
The City Council’s advisors recommended, among other things, overall rate
reductions of approximately $33 million in electric rates and $3.8 million in
gas rates. Certain intervenors recommended overall rate reductions of up to
approximately $49 million in electric rates and $5 million in gas rates. An
evidentiary hearing was held in June 2019, and the record and post-hearing
briefs were submitted in July 2019.

  

In October 2019 the City Council’s Utility Committee approved a resolution for
a change in electric and gas rates for consideration by the full City Council
that included a 9.35% return on common equity, an equity ratio of the lesser
of 50% or Entergy New Orleans’s actual equity ratio, and a total reduction in
revenues that Entergy New Orleans initially estimated to be approximately $39
million ($36 million electric; $3 million gas). At its November 7, 2019
meeting, the full City Council approved the resolution that had previously
been approved by the City Council’s Utility Committee. Based on the approved
resolution, in the fourth quarter 2019 Entergy New Orleans recorded an accrual
of $10 million that reflects the estimate of the revenue billed in 2019 to be
refunded to customers in 2020 based on an August 2019 effective date for the
rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans also recorded a total of $12 million in
regulatory assets for rate case costs and information technology costs
associated with integrating Algiers customers with Entergy New Orleans’s
legacy system and records. Entergy New Orleans will also be allowed to recover
$10 million of retired general plant costs over a 20-year period.

  

The resolution directed Entergy New Orleans to submit a compliance filing
within 30 days of the date of the resolution to facilitate the eventual
implementation of rates, including all necessary calculations and conforming
rate schedules and riders. The electric formula rate plan rider includes,
among other things, 1) a provision for forward-looking adjustments to include
known and measurable changes realized up to 12 months after the evaluation
period; 2) a decoupling mechanism; and 3) recognition that Entergy New Orleans
is authorized to make an in-service adjustment to the formula rate plan to
include the non-fuel cost of the New Orleans Power Station in

rates, unless the two pending appeals in the New Orleans Power Station
proceeding have not concluded. Under this circumstance, Entergy New Orleans
shall be permitted to defer the New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs,
including the cost of capital, until Entergy New Orleans commences non-fuel
cost recovery. After taking into account the requirements for submission of
the compliance filing, the total annual revenue requirement reduction required
by the resolution was refined to approximately $45 million ($42 million
electric, including $29 million in rider reductions; $3 million gas). In
January 2020 the City Council’s advisors found that the rates calculated by
Entergy New Orleans and reflected in the December 2019 compliance filing
should be implemented, except with respect to the City Council-approved energy
efficiency cost recovery rider, which rider calculation should take into
account events to be determined by the City Council in the future. Also in
response to the resolution, Entergy New Orleans filed timely a petition for
appeal and judicial review and for stay of or injunctive relief alleging that
the resolution is unlawful in failing to produce just and reasonable rates. A
hearing on the requested injunction was scheduled in Civil District Court for
February 2020, but by joint motion of the City Council and Entergy New
Orleans, the Civil District Court issued an order for a limited remand to the
City Council to consider a potential agreement in principle/stipulation at its
February 20, 2020 meeting. On February 17, 2020, Entergy New Orleans filed
with the City Council an agreement in principle between Entergy New Orleans
and the City Council’s advisors. On February 20, 2020, the City Council voted
to approve the proposed agreement in principle and issued a resolution
modifying the required treatment of certain accumulated deferred income taxes.
As a result of the agreement in principle, the total annual revenue
requirement reduction will be approximately $45 million ($42 million electric,
including $29 million in rider reductions; and $3 million gas). Entergy New
Orleans fully implemented the new rates in April 2020. In January 2021,
pursuant to the agreement in principle approved by the City Council in October
2020, Entergy New Orleans filed with Civil District Court a motion seeking to
dismiss its petition for judicial review of the City Council’s resolution in
the 2018 combined rate case.

  

Commercial operation of the New Orleans Power Station commenced in May 2020.
In accordance with the City Council resolution issued in the 2018 base rate
case proceeding, Entergy New Orleans had been deferring the New Orleans Power
Station non-fuel costs pending the conclusion of the appellate proceedings. In
October 2020 the Louisiana Supreme Court denied all writ applications relating
to the New Orleans Power Station. With those denials, Entergy New Orleans
began recovering New Orleans Power Station costs in rates in November 2020. As
of December 31, 2020 the regulatory asset for the deferral of New Orleans
Power Station non-fuel costs was $5 million. Entergy New Orleans is recovering
the costs over a five-year period that began in November 2020. In December
2020 the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Sierra Club filed a joint motion
with the City Council to institute a prudence review to investigate the costs
of the New Orleans Power Station. On January 28, 2021, the City Council passed
a resolution giving parties 30 days to respond to the motion. Entergy New
Orleans plans to respond to the motion.

  

2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

Entergy New Orleans’s first annual filing under the three-year formula rate
plan approved by the City Council in November 2019 was originally due to be
filed in April 2020. The authorized return on equity under the approved three-
year formula rate plan is 9.35% for both electric and gas operations. The City
Council approved several extensions of the deadline to allow additional time
to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the New Orleans community,
Entergy New Orleans customers, and Entergy New Orleans itself. In October 2020
the City Council approved an agreement in principle filed by Entergy New
Orleans that results in Entergy New Orleans foregoing its 2020 formula rate
plan filing and shifting the three-year formula rate plan to filings in 2021,
2022, and 2023. Key provisions of the agreement in principle include: changing
the lower of actual equity ratio or 50% equity ratio approved in the rate case
to a hypothetical capital structure of 51% equity and 49% debt for the
duration of the three-year formula rate plan; changing the 2% depreciation
rate for the New Orleans Power Station approved in the rate case to 3%;
retention of over-recovery of $2.2 million in rider revenues; recovery of $1.4
million of certain rate case expenses outside of the earnings band; recovery
of the New Orleans Solar Station costs upon commercial operation; and Entergy
New Orleans’s dismissal of its 2018 rate case appeal.

COVID-19 Orders

  

In March 2020, Entergy New Orleans voluntarily suspended customer
disconnections for non-payment of utility bills through May 2020.
Subsequently, the City Council ordered that the moratorium be extended to
August 1, 2020. In May 2020 the City Council issued an accounting order
authorizing Entergy New Orleans to establish a regulatory asset for
incremental COVID-19-related expenses. In January 2021, Entergy New Orleans
resumed disconnecting service to commercial and small business customers with
past-due balances that have not made payment arrangements. In February 2021
the City Council adopted a resolution suspending residential customer
disconnections for non-payment of utility bills and suspending the assessment
and accumulation of late fees on residential customers with past-due balances
through May 15, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy New Orleans recorded a
regulatory asset of $14.3 million for costs associated with the COVID-19
pandemic.

  

In June 2020 the City Council established the City Council Cares Program and
directed Entergy New Orleans to use the approximately $7 million refund
received from the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales FERC proceeding,
currently being held in escrow, and approximately $15 million of non-
securitized storm reserves to fund this program, which is intended to provide
temporary bill relief to customers who become unemployed during the COVID-19
pandemic. The program became effective July 1, 2020, and offers qualifying
residential customers bill credits of $100 per month for up to four months,
for a maximum of $400 in residential customer bill credits. As of December 31,
2020, credits of $3.4 million have been applied to customer bills under the
City Council Cares Program.

  

Filings with the PUCT and Texas Cities (Entergy Texas)

  

Retail Rates

  

2018 Base Rate Case

  

In May 2018, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking an
increase in base rates and rider rates of approximately $166 million, of which
$48 million is associated with moving costs currently being collected through
riders into base rates such that the total incremental revenue requirement
increase is approximately $118 million. The base rate case was based on a
12-month test year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, Entergy Texas
included capital additions placed into service for the period of April 1, 2013
through December 31, 2017, as well as a post-test year adjustment to include
capital additions placed in service by June 30, 2018.

  

In October 2018 the parties filed an unopposed settlement resolving all issues
in the proceeding and a motion for interim rates effective for usage on and
after October 17, 2018. The unopposed settlement reflects the following terms:
a base rate increase of $53.2 million (net of costs realigned from riders and
including updated depreciation rates), a $25 million refund to reflect the
lower federal income tax rate applicable to Entergy Texas from January 25,
2018 through the date new rates are implemented, $6 million of capitalized
skylining tree hazard costs will not be recovered from customers, $242.5
million of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes
a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through base rates under the
average rate assumption method over the lives of the associated assets, and
$185.2 million of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which
includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through a rider. The
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes rider will include
carrying charges and will be in effect over a period of 12 months for large
customers and over a period of four years for other customers. The settlement
also provides for the deferral of $24.5 million of costs associated with the
remaining book value of the Neches and Sabine 2 plants, previously taken out
of service, to be recovered over a ten-year period and the deferral of $20.5
million of costs associated with Hurricane Harvey to be recovered over a
12-year period, each beginning in October 2018. The settlement provides final
resolution of all issues in the matter, including those related to the Tax
Act. In October 2018 the ALJ granted the unopposed motion for interim rates to
be effective for service rendered on or after October 17, 2018. In December
2018 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.

Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider

  

In March 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF
rider. The proposed new DCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $3.2
million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital
invested in distribution between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018. In
September 2019 the PUCT issued an order approving rates, which had been
effective on an interim basis since June 2019, at the level proposed in
Entergy Texas’s application.

  

In March 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $23.6 million annually, or $20.4 million in
incremental annual DCRF revenue beyond Entergy Texas’s then-effective DCRF
rider, based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2019
and December 31, 2019. In May and June 2020 intervenors filed testimony
recommending reductions in Entergy Texas’s annual revenue requirement of
approximately $0.3 million and $4.1 million. The parties briefed the contested
issues in this matter and a proposal for decision was issued in September 2020
recommending a $4.1 million revenue reduction related to non-Advanced Metering
System meters included in the DCRF calculation. The parties filed exceptions
to the proposal for decision and replies to those exceptions in September
2020. In October 2020 the PUCT issued a final order approving a $16.3 million
incremental annual DCRF revenue increase.

  

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $26.3 million annually, or $6.8 million in incremental
annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s currently effective DCRF rider based on
its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2020 and August 31,
2020. In February 2021 the administrative law judge with the State Office of
Administrative Hearings approved Entergy Texas's agreed motion for interim
rates, which will go into effect in March 2021. The administrative law judge
also adopted a procedural schedule setting a hearing on the merits, if
necessary, in April 2021.

  

Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider

  

In December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new
TCRF rider. The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately
$2.7 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its
capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30,
2018. In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth
adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas’s proposed TCRF revenue
requirement. In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas’s application as
filed to begin recovery of the requested $2.7 million annual revenue
requirement, rejecting opposing parties’ proposed adjustment; however, the
PUCT found that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should
be determined in Entergy Texas’s next rate case similar to the procedure used
for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider. In October 2019 the PUCT
issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior
order granting Entergy Texas’s application as filed. Also in October 2019 a
second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in
opposition to the motion. The second motion for rehearing was overruled by
operation of law. In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an
appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in
declining to apply a load growth adjustment.

  

In August 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF
rider. The amended TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $19.4
million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital
invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, which is
$16.7 million in incremental annual revenue above the $2.7 million approved in
the prior pending TCRF proceeding. In January 2020 the PUCT issued an order
approving an unopposed settlement providing for recovery of the requested
revenue requirement. Entergy Texas implemented the amended rider beginning
with bills covering usage on and after January 23, 2020.

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $51 million annually, or $31.6 million in incremental
annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s currently effective TCRF rider based on
its capital invested in transmission between July 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020.
A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in March 2021.
In February 2021, Entergy Texas filed an agreed motion to abate the procedural
schedule, noting that the parties had reached a settlement in principle, and
the administrative law judge granted the motion to abate.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In March 2020 the PUCT authorized electric utilities to record as a regulatory
asset expenses resulting from the effects of COVID-19. In future proceedings
the PUCT will consider whether each utility's request for recovery of these
regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, the appropriate period of
recovery, and any amount of carrying costs thereon. In March 2020 the PUCT
ordered a moratorium on disconnections for nonpayment for all customer
classes, but, in April 2020, revised the disconnect moratorium to apply only
to residential customers. The PUCT allowed the moratorium to expire on June
13, 2020, but on July 17, 2020, the PUCT re-established the disconnect
moratorium for residential customers until August 31, 2020. In January 2021,
Entergy Texas resumed disconnections for customers with past-due balances that
have not made payment arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Texas
recorded a regulatory asset of $12.9 million for costs associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Generation Cost Recovery Rider

  

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to establish a generation
cost recovery rider with an initial annual revenue requirement of
approximately $91 million to begin recovering a return of and on its capital
investment in the Montgomery County Power Station through August 31, 2020. In
December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement supporting a
generation cost recovery rider with an annual revenue requirement of
approximately $86 million. The settlement revenue requirement is based on a
depreciation rate intended to fully depreciate Montgomery County Power Station
over 38 years and the removal of certain costs from Entergy Texas’s request.
Under the settlement, Entergy Texas retains the right to propose a different
depreciation rate and seek recovery of a majority of the costs removed from
its request in its next base rate proceeding. On January 14, 2021, the PUCT
approved the generation cost recovery rider settlement rates on an interim
basis and abated the proceeding. Within 60 days of Montgomery County Power
Station being placed in service on January 1, 2021, Entergy Texas will file to
update its generation cost recovery rider to include investment in Montgomery
County Power Station after August 31, 2020. The current estimated cost of
Montgomery County Power Station, including transmission interconnection and
network upgrades, is approximately $921 million. Of this investment,
approximately $765 million is eligible to begin being recovered through the
generation cost recovery rider. Entergy Texas will address recovery of the
remainder of its Montgomery County Power Station investment through other rate
mechanisms.

  

In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to amend its generation
cost recovery rider to reflect its acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking
Facility, which is expected to close in April 2021. The initial generation
cost recovery rider rates proposed in the application represent no change from
the generation cost recovery rider rates to be established in Entergy Texas’
previous generation cost recovery rider proceeding. Once Entergy Texas has
acquired the Hardin County Peaking Facility, its investment in the facility
will be reflected in the updated filing to Entergy Texas’ application, which
will be made within 60 days of the acquisition’s closing.

Entergy Arkansas Opportunity Sales Proceeding

  

In June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine
that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties:
(a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy
generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy
System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System
generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement
that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer
of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies. The LPSC’s
complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds. In
July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint
arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the
Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own
account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load
(or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company. The FERC
subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.

  

After a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010. The ALJ
found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales
to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the
same manner as joint account sales. The ALJ concluded that “shareholders”
should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along
with interest. Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial
decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.

  

The FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System
Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility
operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and
Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. The FERC found,
however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an
individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with
such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation
authority. The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting
methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was
inconsistent with the System Agreement. The FERC in its decision established
further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity
sales in accordance with the FERC’s June 2012 decision. The hearing was held
in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013. The LPSC,
the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or
briefs opposing exceptions. Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting
that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain
exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff.

  

In April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed
in July 2012 and the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision. The first order
denied Entergy’s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC’s earlier rulings
that Entergy’s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the
opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make
payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same
position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation. The
FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments. The second
order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ’s August
2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to
calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility
operating companies. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s ruling that a full re-run of
intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be
modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy
allocation as joint account sales. The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision that
any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by 20%. The FERC also
reversed the ALJ’s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service
schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when
calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas. The FERC held that
such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account
but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address whether a cap on any
reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other
adjustments to the calculation methodology.

  

In May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC’s
April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be
reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC’s approval of certain contracts.
Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of
the FERC’s April 2016 order

addressing the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision. The APSC and the LPSC also
filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order.  In September
2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue
of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating
companies should be reduced due to the timing of the LPSC’s approval of
Entergy Arkansas’s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy Louisiana. In
November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the remaining requests
for rehearing of the April 2016 order. In November 2017, Entergy Services
filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC’s orders in the
first two phases of the opportunity sales case. In December 2017 the D.C.
Circuit granted Entergy Services’ request to hold the appeal in abeyance
pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC. In January
2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in the D.C.
Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy Services’
appeal.

  

The hearing required by the FERC’s April 2016 order was held in May 2017. In
July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any
reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the
other adjustments to the calculation methodology. In August 2017 the Utility
operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual
briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision. In
September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC,
the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions
taken by various parties.

  

Based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the
April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a
liability of $87 million, which included interest, for its estimated increased
costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred
fuel regulatory asset of $75 million. Following its assessment of the course
of the proceedings, including the FERC’s denial of rehearing in November 2017
described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas recorded an
additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million.

  

In October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ’s July 2017
initial decision. The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision to cap the reduction in
Entergy Arkansas’s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments
that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies. The FERC also
reversed the ALJ’s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through
September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s
payment. The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ’s rejection of the LPSC’s
claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the
calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment. In November 2018 the LPSC requested
rehearing of the FERC’s October 2018 decision. In December 2019 the FERC
denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing. In January 2020 the LPSC appealed the
December 2019 decision to the D.C. Circuit.

  

In December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC’s
October 2018 order. The compliance filing provided a final calculation of
Entergy Arkansas’s payments to the other Utility operating companies,
including interest. No protests were filed in response to the December 2018
compliance filing. The December 2018 compliance filing is pending FERC action.
Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to
the other operating companies in December 2018:

Entergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of
$116 million as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a
result of this proceeding.

  

As described above, the FERC’s opportunity sales orders have been appealed to
the D.C. Circuit. In February 2020 all of the appeals were consolidated and in
April 2020 the D.C. Circuit established a briefing schedule. Briefing was
completed in September 2020 and oral argument was heard in December 2020.

  

In February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that
were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018
order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding. In March 2019,
Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint. In
November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC’s complaint. The order
concluded that the settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015
terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC’s new complaint. In December
2019 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s November 2019 order, and in
July 2020 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC’s request for
rehearing. In September 2020 the LPSC appealed to the D.C. Circuit the FERC’s
orders dismissing the new opportunity sales complaint. In November 2020 the
D.C. Circuit issued an order establishing that briefing will occur in January
2021 through April 2021.

  

In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony
with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the
costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period. The
application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30
days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the
rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring
30 days after issuance of the APSC’s order approving the rider. In June 2019
the APSC suspended Entergy Arkansas’s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas’s
motion asking the APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated
proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the
appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC’s October 2018 order and related
FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding. In January 2020 the APSC
adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2020. In January 2020
the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a
joint motion seeking to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s application alleging that
the APSC, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the
application and determined that Entergy Arkansas’s requested relief violates
the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking.
Entergy Arkansas responded to the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting
these arguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding
differ substantially from those the APSC addressed previously and that the
payment resulting from a FERC tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas
seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the
refunds resulting from a FERC tariff amendment that the APSC previously
rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds. In
addition, in January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy
Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of
the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the
payment should be segregated and refunded to customers. In March 2020, Entergy
Arkansas filed rebuttal testimony.

  

In July 2020 the APSC issued a decision finding that Entergy Arkansas’s
application is not in the public interest. The order also directed Entergy
Arkansas to refund to its retail customers within 30 days of the order the
FERC-determined over-collection of $13.7 million, plus interest, associated
with a recalculated bandwidth remedy. In addition to these primary findings,
the order also denied the Attorney General’s request for Entergy Arkansas to
prepare a compliance filing detailing all of the retail impacts from the
opportunity sales and denied a request by the Arkansas Electric Energy
Consumers to recalculate all costs using the revised responsibility ratio.
Entergy Arkansas filed a motion for temporary stay of the 30-day requirement
to allow Entergy Arkansas a reasonable opportunity to seek rehearing of the
APSC order, but in July 2020 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for a
stay and directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers the
component of the total FERC-determined opportunity sales payment that was
associated with increased bandwidth remedy payments of $13.7 million, plus
interest. The refunds were issued in the August 2020 billing cycle. While the
APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s stay request, Entergy Arkansas believes its
actions were prudent and, therefore, the costs, including the $13.7 million,
plus interest, are recoverable. In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas requested
rehearing of the APSC

order, which rehearing was denied by the APSC in August 2020. In September
2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC’s order denying Entergy
Arkansas’s request to recover the costs of these payments. In October 2020 the
APSC filed a motion to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s complaint, to which Entergy
Arkansas responded. Also in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas and the APSC held
a pre-trial conference, and filed a report with the court in January 2021. The
court scheduled a hearing for February 26, 2021 regarding issues addressed in
the pre-trial conference report.

  

Complaints Against System Energy

  

Return on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints

  

In January 2017 the APSC and MPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against
System Energy. The complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity
component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy
sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. Entergy Arkansas also
sells some of its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under separate agreements. The current
return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is 10.94%, which was
established in a rate proceeding that became final in July 2001.

  

The APSC and MPSC complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and
unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it
is excessive. The complaint requests proceedings to investigate the return on
equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the FERC
establish January 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. The complaint includes
return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of
reasonable return on equity for System Energy is between 8.37% and 8.67%.
System Energy answered the complaint in February 2017 and disputes that a
return on equity of 8.37% to 8.67% is just and reasonable. The LPSC and the
City Council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the
complaint. In September 2017 the FERC established a refund effective date of
January 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings
before an ALJ. The parties have been unable to settle the return on equity
issue and a FERC hearing judge was assigned in July 2018. The 15-month refund
period in connection with the APSC/MPSC complaint expired on April 23, 2018.

  

In April 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy
seeking an additional 15-month refund period. The LPSC complaint requests
similar relief from the FERC with respect to System Energy’s return on equity
and also requests the FERC to investigate System Energy’s capital structure.
The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer
expressing support for the complaint, and asked the FERC to consolidate this
proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the APSC and MPSC
in January 2017. System Energy answered the LPSC complaint in May 2018 and
also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In August 2018 the FERC issued
an order dismissing the LPSC’s request to investigate System Energy’s capital
structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a
refund effective date of April 27, 2018. The 15-month refund period in
connection with the LPSC return on equity complaint expired on July 26, 2019.

  

The portion of the LPSC’s complaint dealing with return on equity was
subsequently consolidated with the APSC and MPSC complaint for hearing. The
parties addressed an order (issued in a separate proceeding involving New
England transmission owners) that proposed modifying the FERC’s standard
methodology for determining return on equity. In September 2018, System Energy
filed a request for rehearing and the LPSC filed a request for rehearing or
reconsideration of the FERC’s August 2018 order. The LPSC’s request referenced
an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital
structure claim the FERC had earlier dismissed. The FERC initiated a new
proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and System Energy
submitted a response in October 2018. In January 2019 the FERC set the amended
complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings. Settlement proceedings in
the capital structure proceeding commenced in February 2019. As noted below,
in June 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital
structure complaint was

consolidated with the ongoing return on equity proceeding. The 15-month refund
period in connection with the capital structure complaint was from September
24, 2018 to December 23, 2019.

  

In January 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed direct testimony in the
return on equity proceeding. For the refund period January 23, 2017 through
April 23, 2018, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System
Energy of 7.81% and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity
for System Energy of 8.24%. For the refund period April 27, 2018 through July
27, 2019, and for application on a prospective basis, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.97% and the APSC and MPSC
argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.41%. In March
2019, System Energy submitted answering testimony. For the first refund
period, System Energy’s testimony argues for a return on equity of 10.10%
(median) or 10.70% (midpoint). For the second refund period, System Energy’s
testimony shows that the calculated returns on equity for the first period
fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity,
and thus the second complaint should be dismissed (and the first period return
on equity used going forward). If the FERC nonetheless were to set a new
return on equity for the second period (and going forward), System Energy
argues the return on equity should be either 10.32% (median) or 10.69%
(midpoint).

  

In May 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in
the return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial
staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.89%
based on the application of FERC’s proposed methodology. The FERC trial
staff’s direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on
equity of 9.89% for the first refund period was within the range of
presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund
period, as calculated using a study period ending January 31, 2019 for the
second refund period.

  

In June 2019, System Entergy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed
by the FERC trial staff. Among other things, System Energy’s testimony
rebutted arguments raised by the FERC trial staff and provided updated
calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending May
31, 2019. For that refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that strict
application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the FERC staff
indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return
on equity would be set at 9.65% (median) or 9.74% (midpoint). System Energy’s
testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks
such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes
that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either
9.91% (median) or 10.3% (midpoint). System Energy’s testimony also argues
that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the 10.10%
return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the
range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second
refund period.

  

Also in June 2019, the FERC’s Chief ALJ issued an order terminating settlement
discussions in the amended complaint addressing System Energy’s capital
structure. The ALJ consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with
the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for
the consolidated hearing.

  

In August 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed rebuttal testimony in the
return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to
System Energy’s capital structure. The LPSC re-argues for an authorized return
on equity for System Energy of 7.81% for the first refund period and 7.97% for
the second refund period. The APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on
equity for System Energy of 8.26% for the first refund period and 8.32% for
the second refund period. With respect to capital structure, the LPSC proposes
that the FERC establish a hypothetical capital structure for System Energy for
ratemaking purposes. Specifically, the LPSC proposes that System Energy’s
common equity ratio be set to Entergy Corporation’s equity ratio of 37% equity
and 63% debt. In the alternative, the LPSC argues that the equity ratio should
be no higher than 49%, the composite equity ratio of System Energy and the
other Entergy operating companies who purchase under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement. The APSC and MPSC recommend that 35.98% be set as the common equity
ratio for System Energy. As an alternative, the APSC and MPSC propose that
System Energy’s common equity be set at 46.75% based on the median equity
ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity.

In September 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the
return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff
calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.40% based on
the application of the FERC’s proposed methodology and an updated proxy group.
For the second refund period, based on the study period ending May 31, 2019,
the FERC trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of
9.63%. In September 2019 the FERC trial staff also filed direct and answering
testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure. The FERC trial staff
argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop
System Energy’s return on equity should be used to establish the capital
structure. Using this approach, the FERC trial staff calculates the average
capital structure for its proposed proxy group of 46.74% common equity, and
53.26% debt.

  

In October 2019, System Energy filed answering testimony disputing the FERC
trial staff’s, the LPSC’s, and the APSC’s and MPSC’s arguments for the use of
a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of System Energy’s
actual capital structure is just and reasonable.

  

In November 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve System Energy, the FERC
issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on
equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO. Thereafter, the procedural
schedule in the System Energy proceeding was amended to allow the participants
to file supplemental testimony addressing the order in the MISO transmission
owner proceeding (Opinion No. 569).

  

In February 2020 the LPSC, the MPSC and APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed
supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569 and how it would affect the
return on equity evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System
Energy. For the first refund period, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.44%; the MPSC and APSC
argue for an authorized return on equity of 8.41%; and the FERC trial staff
argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.22%. For the second refund
period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.89%; the MPSC and APSC
argue that an authorized return on equity of 8.01% may be appropriate; and the
FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 8.66%.

  

In April 2020, System Energy filed supplemental answering testimony addressing
Opinion No. 569. System Energy argues that the Opinion No. 569 methodology is
conceptually and analytically defective for purposes of establishing just and
reasonable authorized return on equity determinations and proposes an
alternative approach. As its primary recommendation, System Energy continues
to support the return on equity determinations in its March 2019 testimony for
the first refund period and its June 2019 testimony for the second refund
period. Under the Opinion No. 569 methodology, System Energy calculates a
“presumptively just and reasonable range” for the authorized return on equity
for the first refund period of 8.57% to 9.52%, and for the second refund
period of 8.28% to 9.11%. System Energy argues that these ranges are not just
and reasonable results. Under its proposed alternative methodology, System
Energy calculates an authorized return on equity of 10.26% for the first
refund period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable
range calculated for the second refund period and prospectively.

  

In May 2020 the FERC issued an order on rehearing of Opinion No. 569 (Opinion
No. 569-A). In June 2020 the procedural schedule in the System Energy
proceeding was further revised in order to allow parties to address the
Opinion No. 569-A methodology. Pursuant to the revised schedule, in June 2020,
the LPSC, MPSC and APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed supplemental testimony
addressing Opinion No. 569-A and how it would affect the return on equity
evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System Energy. For the
first refund period, based on their respective interpretations and
applications of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.97%; the MPSC and APSC
argue for an authorized return on equity of 9.24%; and the FERC trial staff
argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.49%. For the second refund
period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the

Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on
equity for System Energy of 7.78%; the MPSC and APSC argue that an authorized
return on equity of 9.15% may be appropriate if the second complaint is not
dismissed; and the FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity
of 9.09% if the second complaint is not dismissed.

  

Pursuant to the revised procedural schedule, in July 2020, System Energy filed
supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569-A. System Energy argues that
strict application of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology produces results
inconsistent with investor requirements and does not provide a sound basis on
which to evaluate System Energy’s authorized return on equity. As its primary
recommendation, System Energy argues for the use of a methodology that
incorporates four separate financial models, including the constant growth
form of the discounted cash flow model and the empirical capital asset pricing
model. Based on application of its recommended methodology, System Energy
argues for an authorized return on equity of 10.12% for the first refund
period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable range
calculated for the second refund period and prospectively. Under the Opinion
No. 569-A methodology, System Energy calculates an authorized return on equity
of 9.44% for the first refund period, which also falls within the
presumptively just and reasonable range calculated for the second refund
period and prospectively.

  

The parties and FERC trial staff filed final rounds of testimony in August
2020. The hearing before a FERC ALJ occurred in late-September through early-
October 2020, post-hearing briefing took place in November and December 2020,
and the initial decision is due in March 2021. System Energy recorded a
provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.

  

Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate
Base Issue

  

In May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy
Services related to System Energy’s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction
originally entered into in December 1988 for an 11.5% undivided interest in
Grand Gulf Unit 1. The complaint alleges that System Energy violated the filed
rate and the FERC’s ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in
Unit Power Sales Agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated
with the sale-leaseback interest, and that System Energy is double-recovering
costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in Unit
Power Sales Agreement billings. The complaint also claims that System Energy
was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the Utility
operating companies that purchase Grand Gulf’s output from System Energy could
have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the MISO markets. The complaint
further alleges that System Energy violated various other reporting and
accounting requirements and should have sought prior FERC approval of the
lease renewal. The complaint seeks various forms of relief from the FERC. The
complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they
were recorded in allegedly non-formula accounts or, alternatively, the
disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years
plus interest. The complaint also asks that the FERC disallow and refund the
lease costs of the sale-leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence,
investigate System Energy’s treatment of a DOE litigation payment, and impose
certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for
retail regulators of the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rates. The APSC,
MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding.

  

In June 2018, System Energy and Entergy Services filed a motion to dismiss and
an answer to the LPSC complaint denying that System Energy’s treatment of the
sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed
rate or any other FERC ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or
otherwise constituted double recovery. The response also argued that the
complaint is inconsistent with a FERC-approved settlement to which the LPSC is
a party and that explicitly authorizes System Energy to recover its lease
payments. Finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the
sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the LPSC complaint fails
to justify any disallowance or refunds. The response also offered to submit
formula rate protocols for the Unit Power Sales Agreement similar to the
procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the MISO tariff. In
September 2018 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and
settlement proceedings. The FERC established a refund effective date of May
18, 2018.

In February 2019 the presiding ALJ ruled that the hearing ordered by the FERC
includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred
income tax should be included in, or excluded from, System Energy’s formula
rate. In March 2019 the LPSC, MPSC, APSC and City Council filed direct
testimony. The LPSC testimony sought refunds that include the renewal lease
payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since July 2015), rate base
reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax
positions, and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-
leaseback interest, as well as interest on those amounts.

  

In June 2019 System Energy filed answering testimony arguing that the FERC
should reject all claims for refunds. Among other things, System Energy argued
that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital
additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent
with the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate, System Energy was not over
or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save costs over the
initial and renewal terms of the leases. System Energy argued that claims for
refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions
should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital,
the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the
underlying tax positions is uncertain. System Energy’s testimony also
challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties.

  

In August 2019 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony
seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The FERC trial staff also argued that System Energy
recovered $32 million more than it should have in depreciation expense for
capital additions. In September 2019, System Energy filed cross-answering
testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s arguments for refunds, stating that
the FERC trial staff’s position regarding depreciation rates for capital
additions is not unreasonable, but explaining that any change in depreciation
expense is only one element of a Unit Power Sales Agreement re-billing
calculation. Adjustments to depreciation expense in any re-billing under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to
accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula
elements as needed. In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony
increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The LPSC seeks approximately $512 million plus
interest, which is approximately $191 million through December 31, 2020. The
FERC trial staff also filed rebuttal testimony in which it seeks refunds of a
similar amount as the LPSC for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions. The LPSC testimony also argued that adjustments to depreciation
rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only.

  

A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ
issued an initial decision. Among other things, the ALJ determined that
refunds were due on three main issues. First, with regard to the lease renewal
payments, the ALJ determined that System Energy is recovering an unjust
acquisition premium through the lease renewal payments, and that System
Energy’s recovery from customers through rates should be limited to the cost
of service based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, which
is approximately $70 million. The ALJ found that the remedy for this issue
should be the refund of lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year
since July 2015) with interest determined at the FERC quarterly interest rate,
which would be offset by the addition of the net book value of the leased
assets in the cost of service. The ALJ did not calculate a value for the
refund expected as a result of this remedy. In addition, System Energy would
no longer recover the lease payments in rates prospectively. Second, with
regard to the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, the ALJ
determined that the liabilities are accumulated deferred income taxes and
System Energy’s rate base should have been reduced for those liabilities. If
the ALJ’s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this issue
through December 31, 2020, is approximately $422 million, plus interest, which
is approximately $110 million through December 31, 2020. The ALJ also found
that System Energy should include liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions as a rate base reduction going forward. Third, with regard to the
depreciation expense adjustments, the ALJ found that System Energy should
correct for the error in re-billings retroactively and prospectively, but that
System Energy should not be permitted to recover interest on any retroactive
return on enhanced rate base resulting from such corrections. If the initial
decision is affirmed on this issue, System Energy estimates refunds of
approximately $19 million, which includes interest through December 31, 2020.

The ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process,
and an ALJ’s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on
the FERC. The ALJ in the initial decision acknowledges that these are issues
of first impression before the FERC. In June 2020, System Energy, the LPSC,
and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions, challenging several of
the initial decision’s findings. System Energy’s brief on exceptions
challenged the initial decision’s limitations on recovery of the lease renewal
payments, its proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions, and its proposal to asymmetrically treat interest on
bill corrections for depreciation expense adjustments. The LPSC’s and the FERC
trial staff’s briefs on exceptions each challenged the initial decision’s
allowance for recovery of the cost of service associated with the lease
renewal based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, its
calculation of the remaining net book value of the leased assets, and the
amount of the initial decision’s proposed rate base refund for the liabilities
associated with uncertain tax positions. The LPSC’s brief on exceptions also
challenged the initial decision’s proposal that depreciation expense
adjustments include retroactive adjustments to rate base and its finding that
section 203 of the Federal Power Act did not apply to the lease renewal. The
FERC trial staff’s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision’s
finding that the FERC need not institute a formal investigation into System
Energy’s tariff. In October 2020, System Energy, the LPSC, the MPSC, the APSC,
and the City Council filed briefs opposing exceptions. System Energy opposed
the exceptions filed by the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The LPSC, MPSC,
APSC, City Council, and the FERC trial staff opposed the exceptions filed by
System Energy. Also in October 2020 the MPSC, APSC, and the City Council filed
briefs adopting the exceptions of the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The case
is pending before the FERC, which will review the case and issue an order on
the proceeding, and the FERC may accept, reject, or modify the ALJ’s initial
decision in whole or in part. Refunds, if any, that might be required will
only become due after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial
decision.

  

In addition, in September 2020, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment
(NOPA) and Entergy executed it. The NOPA memorializes the IRS’s decision to
adjust the 2015 consolidated federal income tax return of Entergy Corporation
and certain of its subsidiaries, including System Energy, with regard to the
uncertain decommissioning tax position. Pursuant to the audit resolution
documented in the NOPA, the IRS allowed System Energy’s inclusion of $102
million of future nuclear decommissioning costs in System Energy’s cost of
goods sold for the 2015 tax year, roughly 10% of the requested deduction, but
disallowed the balance of the position. In September 2020, System Energy filed
a motion to lodge the NOPA into the record in the FERC proceeding. In October
2020 the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff
filed oppositions to System Energy’s motion. As a result of the NOPA issued by
the IRS in September 2020, System Energy filed, in October 2020, a new Federal
Power Act section 205 filing at FERC to establish an ongoing rate base credit
for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning
uncertain tax position. On a prospective basis beginning with the October 2020
bill, System Energy proposes to include the accumulated deferred income taxes
arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax
position as a credit to rate base under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In
November 2020 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the
filing, and System Energy responded.

  

In November 2020 the IRS issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for the
2014/2015 tax year and in December 2020 Entergy executed it. The RAR contained
the same adjustment to the uncertain nuclear decommissioning tax position as
that which the IRS had announced in the NOPA. In December 2020, System Energy
filed a motion to lodge the RAR into the record in the FERC proceeding
addressing the uncertain tax position rate base issue. In January 2021 the
LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the motion.

  

As a result of the RAR, in December 2020, System Energy filed amendments to
its new Federal Power Act section 205 filings to establish an ongoing rate
base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the
decommissioning uncertain tax position and to credit excess accumulated
deferred income taxes arising from the successful portion of the
decommissioning uncertain tax position. The amendments both propose the
inclusion of the RAR as support for the filings. In December 2020 the LPSC,
APSC, and City Council filed a protest in response to the amendments,
reiterating their prior objections to the filings. In February 2021 the FERC
issued an

order accepting System Energy’s Federal Power Act section 205 filings subject
to refund, setting them for hearing, and holding the hearing in abeyance.

  

In December 2020, System Energy filed a new Federal Power Act section 205
filing to provide a one-time, historical credit of $25.2 million for the
accumulated deferred income taxes that would have been created by the
decommissioning uncertain tax position if the IRS’s decision had been known in
2016. In January 2021 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest
to the filing.

  

LPSC Authorization of Additional Complaints

  

In May 2020 the LPSC authorized its staff to file additional complaints at the
FERC related to the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf energy and
capacity supplied to Entergy Louisiana under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.
The LPSC directive notes that the initial decision issued by the presiding ALJ
in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback complaint proceeding did not address, for
procedural reasons, certain rate issues raised by the LPSC and declined to
order further investigation of rates charged by System Energy. The LPSC
directive authorizes its staff to file complaints at the FERC “necessary to
address these rate issues, to request a full investigation into the rates
charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf power, and to seek rate refund, rate
reduction, and such other remedies as may be necessary and appropriate to
protect Louisiana ratepayers.” The LPSC directive further stated that the LPSC
has seen “information suggesting that the Grand Gulf plant has been
significantly underperforming compared to other nuclear plants in the United
States, has had several extended and unexplained outages, and has been plagued
with serious safety concerns.” The LPSC expressed concern that the costs paid
by Entergy Louisiana's retail customers may have been detrimentally impacted,
and authorized “the filing of a FERC complaint to address these performance
issues and to seek appropriate refund, rate reduction, and other remedies as
may be appropriate.”

  

The first of the additional complaints was filed at the FERC by the LPSC, the
APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council in September 2020. The new complaint
raises two sets of rate allegations: violations of the filed rate and a
corresponding request for refunds for prior periods; and elements of the Unit
Power Sales Agreement are unjust and unreasonable and a corresponding request
for refunds for the 15-month refund period and changes to the Unit Power Sales
Agreement prospectively. Several of the filed rate allegations overlap with
the previous complaints. The filed rate allegations not previously raised are
that System Energy: failed to provide a rate base credit to customers for the
“time value” of sale-leaseback lease payments collected from customers in
advance of the time those payments were due to the owner-lessors; improperly
included certain lease refinancing costs in rate base as prepayments;
improperly included nuclear decommissioning outage costs in rate base; failed
to include categories of accumulated deferred income taxes as a reduction to
rate base; charged customers based on a higher equity ratio than would be
appropriate due to excessive retained earnings; and did not correctly reflect
money pool investments and imprudently invested cash into the money pool. The
elements of the Unit Power Sales Agreement that the complaint alleges are
unjust and unreasonable include: incentive and executive compensation, lack of
an equity re-opener, lobbying, and private airplane travel. The new complaint
also requests a rate investigation into the Unit Power Sales Agreement and
System Energy’s billing practices pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power
Act, including any issue relevant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its
inputs. System Energy filed its answer opposing the new complaint in November
2020. In its answer, System Energy argued that all of the claims raised in the
complaint should be dismissed and agreed that bill adjustment with respect to
two discrete issues were justified. System Energy argued that dismissal is
warranted because all claims fall into one or more of the following
categories: the claims have been raised and are being litigated in another
proceeding; the claims do not present a prima facie case and do not satisfy
the threshold burden to establish a complaint proceeding; the claims are
premised on a theory or request relief that is incompatible with federal law
or FERC policy; the claims request relief that is inconsistent with the filed
rate; the claims are barred or waived by the legal doctrine of laches; and/or
the claims have been fully addressed and do not warrant further litigation.
In December 2020, System Energy filed a bill adjustment report indicating that
$3.4 million had been credited to customers in connection with the two
discrete issues concerning the inclusion of certain accumulated deferred
income taxes balances in rates. In January 2021 the

complainants filed a response to System Energy’s November 2020 answer, and in
February 2021, System Energy filed a response to the complainant’s response.

  

The operational prudence-related complaint has not been filed as of this date,
and the LPSC directive did not set a date for the filing.

  

Unit Power Sales Agreement

  

In August 2017, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the
Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand
Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The filing proposes limited amendments
to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in
calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2)
updated nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of
which are recovered through the Unit Power Sales Agreement rate formula. The
amendments result in lower charges to the Utility operating companies that buy
capacity and energy from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.
The changes were based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning
studies that take into account the renewal of Grand Gulf’s operating license
for a term through November 1, 2044.

  

In September 2017 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed Unit Power Sales
Agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness
and reasonableness of the amendments. Because the amendments proposed a rate
decrease, the FERC also initiated an investigation under section 206 of the
Federal Power Act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than
proposed. The FERC accepted the proposed amendments effective October 1, 2017,
subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing
proceedings, and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2017 with
respect to the rate decrease. In June 2018, System Energy filed with the FERC
an uncontested settlement relating to the updated depreciation rates and
nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements. In August 2018 the
FERC issued an order accepting the settlement. In the third quarter 2018,
System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately
$26 million, representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense
resulting from the depreciation rates used from October 11, 2017 through
September 30, 2018 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement
filing accepted by the FERC.

  

Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators

  

Entergy Louisiana

  

Hurricane Isaac

  

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy Louisiana’s
service area. In June 2014 the LPSC authorized Entergy Louisiana to utilize
Louisiana Act 55 financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs.
Entergy Louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $30.8 million
of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $6.2
million for five years. Approvals for the Act 55 financings were obtained from
the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) and the Louisiana State
Bond Commission.

  

In August 2014 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and
Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $314.85 million in bonds under
Louisiana Act 55. From the $309 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to
the LURC, the LURC deposited $16 million in a restricted escrow account as a
storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $293 million
directly to Entergy Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana used the $293 million
received from the LURC to acquire 2,935,152.69 Class C preferred, non-voting,
membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-
owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 7.5% annual distribution rate.
Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2014, and the
membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred
membership

interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten
years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership
interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings
Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of
at least $1.75 billion.

  

Entergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on
their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and
there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a
bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system
restoration charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the
bond indenture trustee. Entergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the
collections as revenue because Entergy Louisiana is merely acting as the
billing and collection agent for the state.

  

In the first quarter 2020, Entergy and the IRS agreed upon and settled on the
treatment of funds received by Entergy Louisiana in conjunction with the Act
55 financing of Hurricane Isaac storm costs, which resulted in a net reduction
of income tax expense of approximately $32 million. As a result of the
settlement, the position was partially sustained and Entergy Louisiana
recorded a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $58 million
primarily due to the reversal of liabilities for uncertain tax positions in
excess of the agreed-upon settlement. Entergy recorded an increase to income
tax expense of $26 million primarily resulting from the reduction of the
deferred tax asset, associated with utilization of the net operating loss as a
result of the settlement. This adjustment recorded by Entergy also accounted
for the tax rate change of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of the IRS
settlement, Entergy Louisiana recorded a $29 million ($21 million net-of-tax)
regulatory charge and a corresponding regulatory liability to reflect its
obligation to customers pursuant to the LPSC Hurricane Isaac Act 55 financing
order.

  

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike

  

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic
damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory. In December 2009, Entergy
Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC staff regarding
its storm costs. In March and April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and other parties
to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement
that included Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to utilize Act 55 financing, which
included a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $43.3 million of
customer benefits through a prospective annual rate reduction of $8.7 million
for five years. In April 2010 the LPSC approved the settlement and
subsequently issued financing orders and a ratemaking order intended to
facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the
Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financing. The settlement
agreement allowed for an adjustment to the credits if there was a change in
the applicable federal or state income tax rate. As a result of the enactment
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of the
federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Louisiana Act 55
financing savings obligation regulatory liability related to Hurricane Gustav
and Hurricane Ike was reduced by $2.7 million, with a corresponding increase
to Other regulatory credits on the income statement. The effects of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act are discussed further in Note 3 to the financial statements.

  

In July 2010, the LCDA issued two series of bonds totaling $713.0 million
under Act 55. From the $702.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to
the LURC, the LURC deposited $290 million in a restricted escrow account as a
storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $412.7 million
directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy
Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana used $412.7 million to acquire
4,126,940.15 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of
Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by
Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable
quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have
a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are
callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under
the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include
certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject,
including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion.

Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita

  

In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic
damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory. In March 2008, Entergy
Louisiana and the LURC filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the
LPSC grant a financing order authorizing the financing of Entergy Louisiana
storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 55.
Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for
ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to
customers via a storm cost offset rider. In April 2008 the Louisiana Public
Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the
Act 55 financing, approved requests for the Act 55 financing. Also in April
2008, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested
stipulated settlement that included Entergy Louisiana’s proposal under the Act
55 financing, which included a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of
$40 million of customer benefits through a prospective annual rate reduction
of $8 million for five years. The LPSC subsequently approved the settlement
and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to
facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financing. In May 2008 the Louisiana
State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financing. The
settlement agreement allowed for an adjustment to the credits if there was a
change in the applicable federal or state income tax rate. As a result of the
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of
the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Louisiana Act 55
financing savings obligation regulatory liability related to Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita was reduced by $22.3 million, with a corresponding increase
to Other regulatory credits on the income statement. The effects of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act are discussed further in Note 3 to the financial statements.

  

In July 2008 the LPFA issued $687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned
Act 55. From the $679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC,
the LURC deposited $152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm
damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to
Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from
the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million
that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April
16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-
voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company
wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution
rate. In August 2008, the LPFA issued $278.4 million in bonds under the
aforementioned Act 55. From the $274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the
LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow
account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $187.7
million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by
Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $189.4 million,
including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account
as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 1,893,918.39
Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings
Company LLC that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are
payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation
price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the
option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the
LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial
covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the
requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion.

  

The bonds were repaid in 2018. Entergy and Entergy Louisiana did not report
the bonds issued by the LPFA on their balance sheets because the bonds are the
obligation of the LPFA, and there was no recourse against Entergy or Entergy
Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy
Louisiana collected a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC and
remitted the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy

and Entergy Louisiana did not report the collections as revenue because
Entergy Louisiana was merely acting as the billing and collection agent for
the state.

  

Entergy Mississippi

  

Entergy Mississippi has approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage
provision of $1.75 million per month. If Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated
storm damage provision balance exceeds $15 million, the collection of the
storm damage provision ceases until such time that the accumulated storm
damage provision becomes less than $10 million. Entergy Mississippi’s storm
damage provision balance has been less than $10 million since May 2019, and
Entergy Mississippi has been billing the monthly storm damage provision since
July 2019.

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

  

As a result of the accounting for uncertain tax positions, the amount of the
deferred tax assets reflected in the financial statements is less than the
amount of the tax effect of the federal and state net operating loss
carryovers, tax credit carryovers, and other tax attributes reflected on
income tax returns. Entergy evaluates the available positive and negative
evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the
appropriate character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing
deferred tax assets. When the evaluation indicates that Entergy will not be
able to realize the existing benefits, a valuation allowance is recorded to
reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amount.

  

Because it is more likely than not that the benefits from certain state net
operating loss and other deferred tax assets will not be utilized, valuation
allowances totaling $329 million as of December 31, 2020 and $303 million as
of December 31, 2019 have been provided on the deferred tax assets related to
federal and state jurisdictions in which Entergy does not currently expect to
be able to utilize certain separate company tax return attributes, preventing
realization of such deferred tax assets.

As a result of the accounting for uncertain tax positions, the amount of the
deferred tax assets reflected in the financial statements is less than the
amount of the tax effect of the federal and state net operating loss
carryovers and tax credit carryovers.

  

Unrecognized tax benefits

  

Accounting standards establish a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold
that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial
statements. If a tax deduction is taken on a tax return but does not meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, an increase in income tax
liability, above what is payable on the tax return, is required to be
recorded. A reconciliation of Entergy’s beginning and ending amount of
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

(a)Potential tax liability above what is payable on tax returns

  

The balances of unrecognized tax benefits include $2,208 million, $2,421
million, and $2,161 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018,
respectively, which, if recognized, would lower the effective income tax
rates. Because of the effect of deferred tax accounting, the remaining
balances of unrecognized tax benefits of $3,491 million, $4,962 million, and
$5,020 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, if
disallowed, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate but would
accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

  

Entergy accrues interest expense, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits
in income tax expense. Entergy’s December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 accrued
balance for the possible payment of interest is approximately $44 million, $48
million, and $44 million, respectively. Interest (net-of-tax) of $(4) million,
$4 million, and $7 million was recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

  

A reconciliation of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ beginning and ending amount
of unrecognized tax benefits for 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:

Income Tax Audits

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and various state income tax
returns. IRS examinations are complete for years before 2016. All state taxing
authorities’ examinations are complete for years before 2015. Entergy
regularly defends its positions and works with the IRS to resolve audits. The
resolution of audit issues could result in significant changes to the amounts
of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.

  

2012-2013 IRS Audit

  

The IRS completed its examination of the 2012 and 2013 tax years and issued
its 2012-2013 Revenue Agent Report (RAR) in June 2018. Entergy agreed to all
proposed adjustments contained in the RAR. Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries recorded the effects of these adjustments in June 2018.

  

As a result of the issuance of the RAR, Entergy Louisiana was able to
recognize previously unrecognized tax benefits of $52 million related to the
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita contingent sharing obligation associated
with the Louisiana Act 55 financing.

  

2014-2015 IRS Audit

  

The IRS completed its examination of the 2014 and 2015 tax years and issued
its 2014-2015 RAR in November 2020. Entergy agreed to all proposed adjustments
contained in the RAR. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries recorded the
effects of the adjustments associated with the audit in 2020.

  

In October 2015 two of Entergy’s Louisiana utilities, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, combined their businesses into a legal entity
which is identified as Entergy Louisiana herein. The structure of the business
combination required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes which
resulted in an increase in the tax basis of the assets for Entergy Louisiana.
This resulted in recognition in 2015 of a $334 million permanent difference
and income tax benefit, net of the uncertain tax position recorded on the
transaction.

  

Primarily related to resolution of the business combination issues, completion
of the 2014-2015 IRS audit in 2020 resulted in a $230 million reduction to
deferred income tax expense for Entergy. This reduction to deferred income tax
expense includes: Entergy Louisiana reversing its provision for uncertain tax
position with respect to the business combination, which resulted in a
reduction to deferred income tax expense of $383 million; Entergy Corporation
recording an increase to deferred tax expense of $61 million and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities recording an increase to deferred tax expense of $105
million from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets associated with the
resolved uncertain tax position; and miscellaneous other individually
insignificant benefits totaling $13 million.

  

The completion of the 2014-2015 tax audit also resulted in a $31 million
reduction to income tax expense associated with Entergy Louisiana’s method of
accounting related to the adoption of tangible property regulations.

As a result of the settlement of the tangible property regulation tax
position, Entergy Louisiana was required to record a $33 million ($24 million
net-of-tax) regulatory charge and a corresponding regulatory liability to
reflect its obligation to customers pursuant to a prior regulatory settlement.

  

Finally, upon completion of the 2014-2015 tax audit, Entergy New Orleans
recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $8 million associated with
claims for mark-to-market deductions.

  

In the first quarter 2020, Entergy and the IRS agreed on the treatment of
funds received by Entergy Louisiana in conjunction with the Act 55 financing
of Hurricane Isaac storm costs, which resulted in a net reduction of income
tax expense of approximately $32 million. As a result of the settlement, the
position was partially sustained, and Entergy Louisiana recorded a reduction
of income tax expense of approximately $58 million primarily due to the
reversal of a provision for uncertain tax positions in excess of the agreed-
upon settlement. As a result of the IRS settlement, Entergy Louisiana recorded
a $29 million ($21 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge and a corresponding
regulatory liability to reflect its obligation to customers pursuant to the
LPSC Hurricane Isaac Act 55 financing order.

  

Additional effects of the completion of the 2014-2015 IRS tax audit are
discussed below within Tax Accounting Methods.

  

Other Tax Matters

  

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)

  

Deferred tax liabilities and assets have been adjusted for the effect of the
enactment of the TCJA, signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017. The
most significant effect of the TCJA for Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries was the change in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35%
to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Other significant provisions and their
effect on Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are summarized below.

  

The TCJA limited the deduction for net business interest expense to 30 percent
of adjusted taxable income, which is similar to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The limitation does not apply to
interest expense that is properly allocable to a trade or business classified
as a regulated public utility. This was further modified by a temporary
provision of the CARES Act resulting in an increase of the adjusted taxable
income limitation from 30% to 50% for tax years that begin in 2019 or 2020.

  

The IRS issued proposed regulations relating to this limitation in November
2018 and July 2020. The IRS issued certain final regulations in July 2020 and
January 2021, which were published in the Federal Register in September 2020
and January 2021, respectively. The proposed regulations are generally to be
effective for taxable years ending after the date Treasury adopted the
regulations as final. The final regulations will be effective for Entergy
beginning with the 2021 tax year. Taxpayers may apply the rules of the
proposed regulations to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, as
long as taxpayers consistently apply the rules of the proposed regulations.
The proposed and final regulations provide that if 90% of a tax group’s
consolidated assets consist of regulated utility property, the entire
consolidated tax group will be treated as a regulated public utility and all
of the consolidated group’s interest expense will be currently tax deductible.

  

As a result of the limitation under TCJA, Entergy recorded limitations in 2018
and 2019 and recorded a deferred tax asset on the nondeductible portion, as it
has an unlimited carryover period.  Entergy recorded a valuation allowance of
$24 million due to a lack of earnings from sources other than the Utility. No
limitation was recorded in 2020.

  

The TCJA limited the net operating loss (NOL) deduction for a given year to
80% of taxable income, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years
beginning after December 31, 2017. Only NOLs generated after December 31, 2017
are subject to the 80% limitation. A temporary provision of the CARES Act
(discussed below) removes this limitation and allows corporate taxpayers to
fully offset taxable income with NOLs carried to tax years

beginning before 2021. Prior law generally provided a two-year carryback and
20-year carryforward for NOLs. The TCJA does not allow a carryback period but
does provide for the indefinite carryforward of NOLs arising in tax years
ending after December 31, 2017. However, with the enactment of the CARES Act,
a temporary provision allows for a five-year carryback of 2018-2020 NOLs.
Because of the indefinite carryforward, the new limitations on NOL utilization
are not expected to have a material effect on Entergy or the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

  

The TCJA also modified Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), which limits the
deduction for compensation with respect to certain covered employees to no
more than $1 million per year. The IRS issued proposed regulations relating to
this limitation in December 2019 and final regulations in December 2020. The
significant provisions of the TCJA and associated proposed and final
regulations require inclusion of performance-based compensation and an
expanded definition of “covered employees” in the annual computation of the
section 162 limitation. The TCJA amendments and associated proposed
regulations resulted in an increase in disallowed compensation expense, but
this limitation does not have a material effect on Entergy or the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

  

With respect to the federal corporate income tax rate change from 35% to 21%
in 2017, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries recorded a regulatory
liability associated with the decrease in the net accumulated deferred income
tax liability, which is often referred to as “excess ADIT,” a significant
portion of which has been paid to customers in 2019 and 2020 in the form of
lower rates. Entergy’s December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 balance sheets
reflect a regulatory liability of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively,
as a result of the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities from
the income tax rate change, amortization of excess ADIT, and payments to
customers during 2019 and 2020. Entergy’s regulatory liability for income
taxes includes a gross-up at the applicable tax rate because of the effect
that excess ADIT has on the ratemaking formula. The regulatory liability for
income taxes includes the effect of a) the reduction of the net deferred tax
liability resulting in excess ADIT, b) the tax gross-up of excess ADIT, and c)
the effect of the new tax rate on the previous net regulatory asset for income
taxes. For the same reasons, the Registrant Subsidiaries’ December 31, 2020
and December 31, 2019 balance sheets reflect net regulatory liabilities for
income taxes as follows:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|2020 |  | 2019 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Arkansas | $467 |  |  | $487 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Louisiana | $479 |  |  | $531 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Mississippi | $224 |  |  | $237 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

|System Energy | $152 |  |  | $143 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

Excess ADIT is generally classified into two categories: 1) the portion that
is subject to the normalization requirements of the TCJA, i.e., “protected”,
and 2) the portion that is not subject to such normalization provisions,
referred to as “unprotected”. The TCJA provides that the normalization method
of accounting for income taxes is required for excess ADIT associated with
public utility property. The TCJA provides for the use of the average rate
assumption method (ARAM) for the determination of the timing of the return of
excess ADIT associated with such property. Under ARAM, the excess ADIT is
reduced over the remaining life of the asset. Remaining asset lives vary for
each Registrant Subsidiary, but the average life of public utility property is
typically 30 years or longer. Entergy will amortize the protected portion of
the excess ADIT in conformity with the normalization requirements. The
Registrant Subsidiaries’ net regulatory liability for income taxes as of
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, includes protected excess ADIT as
follows:

During the second quarter of 2018, the Registrant Subsidiaries began paying
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, associated with the
effects of the Act, to their customers through rate riders and other means
approved by their respective regulatory commissions. Payment of the
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes results in a reduction in
the regulatory liability for income taxes and a corresponding reduction in
income tax expense. This has a significant effect on the effective tax rate
for the period as compared to the statutory tax rate. The Registrant
Subsidiaries’ net regulatory liability for income taxes as of December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2019, includes unprotected excess ADIT as follows:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|2020 |  | 2019 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

|System Energy | $16 |  |  | $— |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes reduced
Entergy’s and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ regulatory liability for income
taxes as follows for 2020 and 2019:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

|System Energy | $— |  |  | $7 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

In addition to the protected and unprotected excess ADIT amounts, the net
regulatory liability for income taxes includes other regulatory assets and
liabilities for income taxes associated with AFUDC, which is described in Note
1 to the financial statements.

  

For a discussion of the proceedings commenced or other responses by Entergy’s
regulators to the Act, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

  

Included in the effect of the computation of the changes in deferred tax
assets and liabilities is the recognition threshold and measurement of
uncertain tax positions resulting in unrecognized tax benefits. The final
economic outcome of such unrecognized tax benefits is generally the result of
a negotiated settlement with the IRS that often differs from the amount that
is recorded as realizable under GAAP. The intrinsic uncertainty with respect
to all such tax positions means that the difference between current estimates
of such amounts likely to be realized

120

and actual amounts realized upon settlement may have an effect on income tax
expense and the regulatory liability for income taxes in future periods.

  

Entergy anticipates that the TCJA, including the federal corporate income tax
rate change, may continue to have ramifications that require adjustments in
the future as certain events occur. These events include: 1) the evaluation by
regulators in all of Entergy’s jurisdictions regarding the ratemaking
treatment of TCJA and excess ADIT; 2) IRS audit adjustments to or amendments
of federal and state income tax returns that include modifications to the
computation of taxable income resulting from TCJA; and 3) additional guidance,
interpretations, or rulings by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the IRS.
The potential exists for these types of events to result in future tax expense
adjustments because of the difference in the federal corporate income tax rate
between past and future periods and the effect of the tax rate change on
ratemaking. In turn, these items also could potentially affect the regulatory
liability for income taxes.

  

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act

  

In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump
signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) into
law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provisions that result in the most
significant opportunities for tax relief to Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries are (i) permitting a five-year carryback of 2018-2020 NOLs, (ii)
removing the 80 percent limitation on NOLs carried to tax years beginning
before 2021, (iii) increasing the limitation on interest expense deductibility
for 2019 and 2020, (iv) accelerating available refunds for minimum tax credit
carryforwards, modifying limitations on charitable contributions during 2020,
and (v) delaying the payment of employer payroll taxes. Entergy deferred
approximately $64 million of 2020 payroll tax payments, which will be payable
in two installments of $32 million on December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Restructuring

  

In the third quarter 2018, Entergy completed a restructuring of the investment
holdings in one of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant
decommissioning trusts that resulted in an adjustment to tax basis for the
trust. The accounting standards provide that a taxable temporary difference
does not exist if the tax law provides a means by which an amount can be
recovered without incurrence of tax. The restructuring allows Entergy to
recover assets from the trust without incurring tax. As such, the tax basis
recognized resulted in the reversal of a deferred tax liability and reduction
of income tax expense of approximately $107 million.

  

In the fourth quarter 2019, two separate events occurred resulting in a
reduction of tax expense of $174 million. In November 2019 an Entergy
Wholesale Commodities subsidiary recognized a reduction in income tax expense
of $18 million in connection with the accounting method on power contracts
associated with the Palisades nuclear power station. Additionally, Entergy’s
ownership of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 was restructured. The
restructuring required Entergy to recognize Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3
nuclear decommissioning liabilities for income tax purposes resulting in a tax
accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of
unrecognized tax benefits, by $156 million. The accrual of the nuclear
decommissioning liabilities also required Entergy to recognize a gain for
income tax purposes, a portion of which resulted in an increase in the tax
basis of the assets. Recognition of the gain and the increase in the tax basis
of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference.

  

Immediately prior to the restructuring, through its ownership of Indian Point
2 and Indian Point 3, Entergy donated property to Stony Brook University and
recognized an associated tax deduction resulting in a decrease to tax expense
of $19 million.

  

In the fourth quarter 2020, Entergy’s ownership of Palisades was restructured.
The restructuring required Entergy to recognize Palisades’ nuclear
decommissioning liability for income tax purposes resulting in a tax
accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of
unrecognized tax benefits, by

121

$9.2 million. The accrual of the nuclear decommissioning liability also
required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes, a portion of
which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of the assets. Recognition of
the gain and the increase in the tax basis of the assets represents a tax
accounting temporary difference.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Tax Audit

  

A state income tax audit involving Entergy Wholesale Commodities was concluded
during the third quarter 2018. Upon conclusion of the audit, subsidiaries
within Entergy Wholesale Commodities reversed a portion of the provision for
uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $23 million, net of tax and
interest paid.

  

Tax Accounting Methods

  

In the fourth quarter 2015, System Energy and Entergy Louisiana adopted a new
method of accounting for income tax return purposes in which their nuclear
decommissioning costs will be treated as production costs of electricity
includable in cost of goods sold. The new method resulted in a reduction of
taxable income of $1.2 billion for System Energy and $2.2 billion for Energy
Louisiana.

  

In conjunction with the 2014-2015 IRS audit discussed above, the IRS issued
proposed adjustments concerning the nuclear decommissioning tax position
allowing System Energy to include $102 million of its decommissioning
liability in cost of goods sold, and Entergy Louisiana to include $221 million
of its decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold. Entergy, System
Energy, and Entergy Louisiana agreed to the proposed adjustments included in
the RAR.

  

As a result of System Energy being allowed to include part of its
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold, System Energy and Entergy
recorded a deferred tax liability of $26 million. System Energy also recorded
federal and state taxes payable of $402 million. However, on a consolidated
basis, Entergy utilized tax loss carryovers to offset the federal taxable
income adjustment and did not record federal taxes payable as a result of the
outcome of this uncertain tax position.

  

As a result of Entergy Louisiana being allowed to include part of its
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
recorded a deferred tax liability of $60 million. Both Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy utilized tax loss carryovers to offset the taxable income adjustment
and accordingly did not record taxes payable as a result of the outcome of
this uncertain tax position.

  

The partial disallowance of this uncertain tax position to include the
decommissioning liability in cost of goods sold resulted in a $1.5 billion
decrease in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and
state taxes for Entergy. Additionally, both System Energy and Entergy
Louisiana recorded a reduction to their balances of unrecognized tax benefits
for federal and state taxes of $461 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.

  

Entergy Arkansas adopted the same method of accounting for its nuclear
decommissioning costs which resulted in a $1.8 billion reduction in taxable
income on its 2018 tax return.

  

The tax treatment of Entergy Louisiana’s accrued regulatory liabilities
associated with the Vidalia purchased power agreement and business combination
guaranteed customer credits, which are discussed further in Note 2, has been
resolved with the IRS in a manner that results in a $190 million increase to
previously reported taxable income. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy utilized tax
loss carryovers to offset the taxable income adjustment, however, which
allowed both Entergy Louisiana and Entergy to reduce their balances of federal
and state unrecognized tax benefits by $74 million.

  

In 2016, Entergy Louisiana elected mark-to-market income tax treatment for
various wholesale electric power purchase and sale agreements, including
Entergy Louisiana’s contract to purchase electricity from the Vidalia
hydroelectric facility and from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement. The election resulted in a

122

Notes to Financial Statements

  

$2.2 billion deductible temporary difference. In 2017, Entergy New Orleans
also elected mark-to-market income tax treatment for wholesale electric
contracts which resulted in a $1.1 billion deductible temporary difference. In
2018, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi accrued deductible temporary
differences related to mark-to-market tax accounting for wholesale electric
contracts of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Additionally, in
2020, Entergy Texas elected mark-to-market income tax treatment for wholesale
electric power purchase and sale agreements which resulted in a $2.5 billion
deductible temporary difference.

  

Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi Internal Restructuring

  

In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi became
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC. The change
in ownership required Entergy to recognize Entergy Arkansas’s nuclear
decommissioning liabilities for income tax purposes resulting in a tax
accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of
unrecognized tax benefits, by $165 million. The accrual of the nuclear
decommissioning liabilities also required Entergy to recognize a gain for
income tax purposes, a portion of which resulted in an increase in the tax
basis of the assets. Recognition of the gain and the increase in the tax basis
of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference. Additionally,
Entergy recorded a $5 million reduction of income tax expense associated with
state income tax effects resulting in a total reduction of income tax expense
of $170 million from the restructuring. Entergy recorded a regulatory
liability of $40 million ($30 million net-of-tax) which partially offsets the
reduction of income tax expense. Entergy Arkansas’s member’s equity increased
by $94 million as a result of the restructuring. See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of the internal restructuring.

  

Arkansas Corporate Income Tax Rate Reduction

  

In April 2019 the State of Arkansas enacted corporate income tax law changes
that phase in an Arkansas tax rate reduction from the current rate of 6.5% to
6.2% in 2021 and 5.9% in 2022. The rate reduction will eventually reduce
Entergy Arkansas’s combined federal and state applicable tax rate by less than
0.5% once fully adopted. As a result of the rate reduction, Entergy Arkansas
computed a final regulatory liability for income taxes of approximately $21
million, which includes a tax gross-up related to the treatment of income
taxes in the retail and wholesale ratemaking formulas. During the first
quarter of 2021, Entergy Arkansas refunded $7.5 million to Arkansas retail
customers which represents the retail portion of the $21 million referenced
above offset by the effect of adjustments to the regulatory liability for TCJA
excess accumulated deferred income taxes. The Arkansas tax law enactment also
phases in an increase to the net operating loss carryover period from five to
ten years.

  

Consolidated Income Tax Return of Entergy Corporation

  

In September 2019, Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC and its regulated,
wholly-owned subsidiaries including Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans, became eligible to and joined
the Entergy Corporation consolidated federal income tax group. As a result of
these four Utility operating companies re-joining the Entergy Corporation
consolidated tax return group, Entergy was able to recognize a $41 million
deferred tax asset associated with a previously unrecognized Arkansas net
operating loss carryover.

  

Additionally, in September 2019, Entergy Texas issued $35 million of 5.375%
Series A preferred stock with a liquidation value of $25 per share resulting
in the disaffiliation and de-consolidation of Entergy Texas from the
consolidated federal income tax return of Entergy Corporation. These changes
will not affect the accrual or allocation of income taxes for the Registrant
Subsidiaries. See Note 6 to the financial statements for discussion of the
preferred stock issuance.

Vermont Yankee

  

The Vermont Yankee transaction resulted in Entergy generating a net deferred
tax asset in January 2019. The deferred tax asset could not be fully realized
by Entergy in the first quarter 2019; accordingly, Entergy accrued a net tax
expense of $29 million on the disposition of Vermont Yankee. See Note 14 to
the financial statements for discussion of the Vermont Yankee transaction.

  

Stock Compensation

  

In accordance with stock compensation accounting rules, Entergy and the
Registrant Subsidiaries recognized excess tax deductions as a reduction of
income tax expense in the first quarter 2020. Due to the vesting and exercise
of certain Entergy stock-based awards, Entergy recorded a permanent tax
reduction of approximately $24.7 million, including $4.8 million for Entergy
Arkansas, $8.6 million for Entergy Louisiana, $2.7 million for Entergy
Mississippi, $1.5 million for Entergy New Orleans, $2.7 million for Entergy
Texas, and $1.3 million for System Energy.

  

  

NOTE 4. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, LINES OF CREDIT, AND SHORT-TERM
BORROWINGS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing
capacity of $3.5 billion and expires in September 2024. The facility includes
fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $20 million
of the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The commitment fee is
currently 0.225% of the undrawn commitment amount. Commitment fees and
interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on
the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The weighted average
interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.35% on the drawn
portion of the facility. Following is a summary of the borrowings outstanding
and capacity available under the facility as of December 31, 2020.

(In Millions)  
$3,500| | $165| | $6| | $3,329  
  
  

Entergy Corporation’s credit facility requires Entergy to maintain a
consolidated debt ratio, as defined, of 65% or less of its total
capitalization. Entergy is in compliance with this covenant. If Entergy fails
to meet this ratio, or if Entergy Corporation or one of the Utility operating
companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the facility maturity
date may occur.

  

Entergy Corporation has a commercial paper program with a Board-approved
program limit of up to $2 billion. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy
Corporation had $1.627 billion of commercial paper outstanding. The weighted-
average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 1.39%.

The short-term borrowings of the Registrant Subsidiaries are limited to
amounts authorized by the FERC. The current FERC-authorized limits for Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Texas, and System Energy are effective through July 14, 2022. In addition to
borrowings from commercial banks, these companies may also borrow from the
Entergy System money pool and from other internal short-term borrowing
arrangements. The money pool and the other internal borrowing arrangements are
inter-company borrowing arrangements designed to reduce the Utility

Grand Gulf Sale-Leaseback Transactions

  

In 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions, System
Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for
the aggregate sum of $500 million. The initial term of the leases expired in
July 2015. System Energy renewed the leases for fair market value with renewal
terms expiring in July 2036. At the end of the new lease renewal terms, System
Energy has the option to repurchase the leased interests in Grand Gulf or
renew the leases at fair market value. In the event that System Energy does
not renew or purchase the interests, System Energy would surrender such
interests and their associated entitlement of Grand Gulf’s capacity and
energy.

  

System Energy is required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing
transaction in its financial statements. As such, it has recognized debt for
the lease obligation and retained the portion of the plant subject to the
sale-leaseback on its balance sheet. For financial reporting purposes, System
Energy has recognized interest expense on the debt balance and depreciation on
the applicable plant balance. The lease payments are recognized as principal
and interest payments on the debt balance. However, operating revenues include
the recovery of the lease payments because the transactions are accounted for
as a sale and leaseback for ratemaking purposes. Consistent

Notes to Financial Statements

  

with a recommendation contained in a FERC audit report, System Energy
initially recorded as a net regulatory asset the difference between the
recovery of the lease payments and the amounts expensed for interest and
depreciation and continues to record this difference as a regulatory asset or
liability on an ongoing basis, resulting in a zero net balance for the
regulatory asset at the end of the lease term. The amount was a net regulatory
liability of $55.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

  

As of December 31, 2020, System Energy, in connection with the Grand Gulf sale
and leaseback transactions, had future minimum lease payments that are
recorded as long-term debt, as follows, which reflects the effect of the
December 2013 renewal:

preferred stock and membership interests series may be eligible for the
dividends received deduction.

  

Presentation of Preferred Stock without Sinking Fund

  

Accounting standards regarding non-controlling interests and the
classification and measurement of redeemable securities require the
classification of preferred securities between liabilities and shareholders’
equity on the balance sheet if the holders of those securities have protective
rights that allow them to gain control of the board of directors in certain
circumstances. These rights would have the effect of giving the holders the
ability to potentially redeem their securities, even if the likelihood of
occurrence of these circumstances is considered remote. The outstanding
preferred stock of Entergy Texas has protective rights with respect to unpaid
dividends but provides for the election of board members that would not
constitute a majority of the board, and the preferred stock of Entergy Texas
is therefore classified as a component of equity.

  

The outstanding preferred securities of Entergy Utility Holding Company (a
Utility subsidiary) and Entergy Finance Holding (an Entergy Wholesale
Commodities subsidiary), whose preferred holders have protective rights, are
presented between liabilities and equity on Entergy’s consolidated balance
sheets. The preferred dividends or distributions paid by all subsidiaries are
reflected for all periods presented outside of consolidated net income.

Entergy Corporation reissues treasury shares to meet the requirements of the
Stock Plan for Outside Directors (Directors’ Plan), the four equity plans of
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and certain other stock benefit plans.
The Directors’ Plan awards to non-employee directors a portion of their
compensation in the form of a fixed dollar value of shares of Entergy
Corporation common stock.

  

In October 2010 the Board granted authority for a $500 million share
repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, $350 million of authority remains
under the $500 million share repurchase program.

  

Dividends declared per common share were $3.74 in 2020, $3.66 in 2019, and
$3.58 in 2018.

  

(System Energy)

  

System Energy paid its parent, Entergy Corporation, distributions out of its
common stock of $56.5 million in 2018.

  

Equity Forward Sale Agreements

  

In June 2018, Entergy marketed an equity offering of 15.3 million shares of
common stock. In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Entergy
entered into forward sale agreements with various investment banks. The equity
forwards required Entergy to, at its election prior to June 7, 2019, either
(i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of 15.3 million
shares of its common stock to the investment banks in exchange for net
proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements
(initially $74.45 per share) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or
in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares. The forward sale
price was subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest
rate factor and decreased by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements.

  

In December 2018, Entergy physically settled a portion of its obligations
under the forward sale agreements by delivering 6,834,221 shares of common
stock in exchange for cash proceeds of $500 million. The forward sale price
used to determine the cash proceeds received by Entergy was calculated based
on the initial forward sale price of $74.45 per share as adjusted in
accordance with the forward sale agreements. Entergy incurred approximately
$728 thousand of common stock issuance costs with the settlement.

In May 2019, Entergy physically settled its remaining obligations under the
forward sale agreements by delivering 8,448,171 shares of common stock in
exchange for cash proceeds of $608 million. The forward sale price used to
determine the cash proceeds received by Entergy was calculated based on the
initial forward sale price of $74.45 per share as adjusted in accordance with
the forward sale agreements. Entergy incurred approximately $7 thousand of
common stock issuance costs with the settlement.

  

Entergy used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included
repayment of commercial paper, outstanding loans under Entergy’s revolving
credit facility, and other debt.

  

Retained Earnings and Dividends

  

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10):
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
effective January 1, 2018. The ASU requires investments in equity securities,
excluding those accounted for under the equity method or resulting in
consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value with changes
recognized in net income. Entergy implemented this standard using a modified
retrospective method, and recorded an adjustment increasing retained earnings
and reducing accumulated other comprehensive income by $633 million as of
January 1, 2018 for the cumulative effect of the unrealized gains and losses
on investments in equity securities held by the decommissioning trust funds
that do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment. See Note 16
to the financial statements for further discussion of effects of the new
standard.

  

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” effective January 1, 2018. The ASU
requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity
asset transfers, other than inventory, at the time the transfer occurs.
Entergy implemented this standard using a modified retrospective method, and
recorded an adjustment decreasing retained earnings by $56 million as of
January 1, 2018 for the cumulative effect of recording deferred tax assets on
previously-recognized intra-entity asset transfers.

  

Entergy adopted ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive
Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income,” in the first quarter 2018. The ASU allows a one-
time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained
earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that
would otherwise be stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Entergy’s policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other
comprehensive income for available-for-sale securities is to use the portfolio
approach. Entergy elected to reclassify the $15.5 million of stranded tax
effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act to retained earnings ($32 million decrease) or the regulatory
liability for income taxes ($16.5 million increase). Entergy’s
reclassification only includes the effect of the change in the federal
corporate income tax rate on accumulated other comprehensive income.

  

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):
Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” effective January
1, 2019. The ASU makes a number of amendments to hedge accounting, most
significantly changing the recognition and presentation of highly effective
hedges. Entergy implemented this standard using a modified retrospective
method, and recorded an adjustment increasing retained earnings and increasing
accumulated other comprehensive loss by approximately $8 million as of January
1, 2019 for the cumulative effect of the ineffectiveness portion of designated
hedges on nuclear power sales.

  

Entergy implemented ASU 2017-08 “Receivables (Topic 310): Nonrefundable Fees
and Other Costs” effective January 1, 2019. The ASU amends the amortization
period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium to the
earliest call date. Entergy implemented this standard using the modified
retrospective approach, and recorded an adjustment decreasing retained
earnings and decreasing accumulated other

comprehensive loss by approximately $1 million as of January 1, 2019 for the
cumulative effect of the amended amortization period.

  

Entergy Corporation received dividend payments and distributions from
subsidiaries totaling $113 million in 2020, $124 million in 2019, and $27
million in 2018.

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas,
and System Energy)

  

Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal,
regulatory, and tax proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions,
and governmental agencies in the ordinary course of business. While management
is unable to predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings,
management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
have a material adverse effect on Entergy’s results of operations, cash flows,
or financial condition. Entergy discusses regulatory proceedings in Note 2 to
the financial statements and discusses tax proceedings in Note 3 to the
financial statements.

  

Vidalia Purchased Power Agreement

  

Entergy Louisiana has an agreement extending through the year 2031 to purchase
energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia project.
Entergy Louisiana made payments under the contract of approximately $132.7
million in 2020, $135.5 million in 2019, and $137.6 million in 2018. If the
maximum percentage (94%) of the energy is made available to Entergy Louisiana,
current production projections would require estimated payments of
approximately $141 million in 2021, and a total of $1.41 billion for the years
2022 through 2031. Entergy Louisiana currently recovers the costs of the
purchased energy through its fuel adjustment clause.

  

In an LPSC-approved settlement related to tax benefits from the tax treatment
of the Vidalia contract, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by $11
million each year for up to 10 years, beginning in October 2002. In

October 2011 the LPSC approved a settlement under which Entergy Louisiana
agreed to provide credits to customers by crediting billings an additional
$20.235 million per year for 15 years beginning January 2012. Entergy
Louisiana recorded a regulatory charge and a corresponding regulatory
liability to reflect this obligation. The settlement agreement allowed for an
adjustment to the credits if, among other things, there was a change in the
applicable federal or state income tax rate. As a result of the enactment of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of the federal
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Vidalia purchased power
regulatory liability was reduced by $30.5 million, with a corresponding
increase to Other regulatory credits on the income statement. The effects of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are discussed further in Note 3 to the financial
statements.

  

ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews

  

In March 2013, during a scheduled refueling outage at ANO 1, a contractor-
owned and operated heavy-lifting apparatus collapsed while moving the
generator stator out of the turbine building. The collapse resulted in the
death of an ironworker and injuries to several other contract workers, caused
ANO 2 to shut down, and damaged the ANO turbine building. The total cost of
assessment, restoration of off-site power, site restoration, debris removal,
and replacement of damaged property and equipment was approximately $95
million. Entergy Arkansas has pursued its options for recovering damages that
resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal
action. Entergy Arkansas collected $50 million in 2014 from Nuclear Electric
Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurance company that provides property
damage coverage to the members’ nuclear generating plants. Entergy Arkansas
also collected a total of $21 million in 2018 as a result of stator-related
settlements.

  

In addition, Entergy Arkansas incurred replacement power costs for ANO 2 power
during its outage and incurred incremental replacement power costs for ANO 1
power because the outage extended beyond the originally-planned duration of
the refueling outage. In February 2014 the APSC authorized Entergy Arkansas to
retain the $65.9 million in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be
reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims
associated with the ANO stator incident is available.

  

In March 2015, after several NRC inspections and regulatory conferences,
arising from the stator incident, the NRC placed ANO into the
“multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 4, of the NRC’s
Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix. Entergy Arkansas incurred incremental
costs of approximately $53 million in 2015 to prepare for the NRC inspections
that began in early 2016 in order to address the issues required to move ANO
back to “licensee response” or Column 1 of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process
Action Matrix. Excluding remediation and response costs that resulted from the
additional NRC inspection activities, Entergy Arkansas incurred approximately
$44 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017 in support of NRC inspection
activities and to implement Entergy Arkansas’s performance improvement
initiatives developed in 2015. In June 2018 the NRC moved ANO 1 and ANO 2 into
the “licensee response column,” or Column 1, of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight
Process Action Matrix.

  

In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its
formula rate plan rider. In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement
agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires
Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of
recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator
incident, including the $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy
costs and costs related to the incremental oversight previously noted, subject
to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement.

  

Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation

  

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a
specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all
spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by
domestic nuclear power reactors. Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries
have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent
nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The
affected

Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to
furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold
after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date.
Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel,
except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense.
Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to
regulatory authorities for the Utility plants. Following the defunding of the
Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking
cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after
April 7, 1983 fee. In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered
the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to zero until the
DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an
alternative waste disposal plan. In January 2014 the DOE submitted the
proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing
with the D.C. Circuit. The petition for rehearing was denied. The zero spent
fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014.

  

Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance
with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel
disposal contracts. As a result of the DOE’s failure to begin disposal of
spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee
subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages. Beginning in
November 2003 these subsidiaries have pursued litigation to recover the
damages caused by the DOE’s delay in performance. Following are details of
final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2018, 2019, and 2020 related to
Entergy’s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries’ litigation with the DOE.

  

In September 2018 the DOE submitted an offer of judgment to resolve claims in
the second round Entergy Nuclear Generation Company case involving Pilgrim.
The $62 million offer was accepted by Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, and
the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in that amount in favor of
Entergy Nuclear Generation Company. Entergy received payment from the U.S.
Treasury in October 2018. The effect in 2018 of recording the judgment was a
reduction to plant and other operation and maintenance expenses. The Pilgrim
damages awarded included $60 million related to costs previously capitalized
and $2 million related to costs previously recorded as other operation and
maintenance expense. Of the $60 million, Entergy recorded $4 million as a
reduction to previously-recorded depreciation expense, a $10 million reduction
to bring its remaining Pilgrim plant asset balance to zero, and the excess $46
million as a reduction to other operation and maintenance expense because
Pilgrim’s plant asset balance is fully impaired.

  

In August 2019 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a final judgment in the
amount of $19 million in favor of Entergy Louisiana against the DOE in the
second round River Bend damages case. Entergy Louisiana received payment from
the U.S. Treasury in September 2019. The effects in 2019 of recording the
judgment were reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense, and other operation
and maintenance expense. The River Bend damages awarded included $12 million
related to costs previously recorded as nuclear fuel expense, $5 million
related to costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance
expense, and $2 million in costs previously capitalized.

  

In December 2019 the DOE submitted an offer of judgment to resolve claims in
the third round ANO damages case. The $80 million offer was accepted by
Entergy Arkansas, and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in
that amount in favor of Entergy Arkansas and against the DOE. Entergy Arkansas
received payment from the U.S. Treasury in January 2020. The effects in 2019
of recording the judgment were reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense,
other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense, and taxes other
than income taxes. The ANO damages awarded included $55 million in costs
previously capitalized, $12 million related to costs previously recorded as
nuclear fuel expense, $12 million related to costs previously recorded as
other operation and maintenance expense, and $1 million related to costs
previously recorded as taxes other than income taxes. Of the $55 million,
Entergy Arkansas, recorded $5 million as a reduction to previously-recorded
depreciation expense.

  

In December 2019 the Entergy FitzPatrick Properties (formerly Entergy Nuclear
FitzPatrick) and the DOE entered into a settlement agreement and the U.S.
Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in the amount of $7

million in favor of Entergy FitzPatrick Properties against the DOE in the
second round FitzPatrick damages case. Entergy received payment from the U.S.
Treasury in January 2020. Substantially all of the FitzPatrick damages awarded
relate to costs previously expensed as asset write-offs, impairments, and
related charges, and in December 2019 Entergy recorded $7 million as a
reduction to asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges.

  

In April 2020 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a final judgment in the
amount of $33 million in favor of Entergy Louisiana against the DOE in the
second round Waterford 3 damages case. Entergy Louisiana received payment from
the U.S. Treasury in June 2020. The effects of recording the judgment were
reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense, and other operation and maintenance
expense. The Waterford 3 damages awarded included $20 million related to costs
previously recorded as nuclear fuel expense, $8 million related to costs
previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expenses, and $5
million in costs previously capitalized.

  

In October 2020 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a final judgment in
the amount of $40.5 million in favor of System Energy and against the DOE in
the third round Grand Gulf damages case. System Energy received payment from
the U.S. Treasury in December 2020. The effects of recording the judgment were
reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense, and other operation and maintenance
expense. The amounts of Grand Gulf damages awarded related to System Energy’s
90% ownership of Grand Gulf included $5 million related to costs previously
capitalized, $21 million related to costs previously recorded as nuclear fuel
expense, and $10 million related to costs previously recorded as other
operation and maintenance expense.

  

In January 2021 the U.S. Court of Federal Clams issued a final judgment in the
amount of $23.1 million in favor of Entergy Nuclear Palisades and against the
DOE in the second round Palisades damages case. Entergy received payment from
the U.S. Treasury in February 2021. The effects of recording the judgment were
reductions to plant, other operation and maintenance expense, and taxes other
than income taxes. The Palisades damages awarded included $15.7 million
related to costs previously capitalized, $7.1 million related to costs
previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expenses, and $0.3
million related to costs previously recorded as taxes other than income taxes.
Of the $15.7 million previously capitalized, Entergy recorded $9.1 million as
a reduction to previously-recorded depreciation expense.

  

Management cannot predict the timing or amount of any potential recoveries on
other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and cannot predict the timing of
any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims damage
awards.

  

Nuclear Insurance

  

Third Party Liability Insurance

  

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and
participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for
the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The costs of this
insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and
renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-
Anderson Act requires nuclear power plants to show evidence of financial
protection in the event of a nuclear accident. This protection must consist of
two layers of coverage:

  

1.The primary level is private insurance underwritten by American Nuclear
Insurers (ANI) and provides public liability insurance coverage of $450
million for each operating reactor. If this amount is not sufficient to cover
claims arising from an accident, the second level, Secondary Financial
Protection, applies.

2.Within the Secondary Financial Protection level, each nuclear reactor has a
contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its
proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless of
proximity to the incident or fault, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6
million per reactor per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent
obligation per incident is $1.101 billion). This retrospective

148

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

  

premium is payable at a rate currently set at approximately $21 million per
year per incident per nuclear power reactor.

3.In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause a nuclear power plant
accident, which results in third-party damages – off-site property and
environmental damage, off-site bodily injury, and on-site third-party bodily
injury (i.e. contractors), the primary level provided by ANI combined with the
Secondary Financial Protection would provide approximately $14 billion in
coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a
government program that provides for up to $100 billion in coverage in excess
of existing coverage for a terrorist event. Under current law, the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act extends through 2027.

  

The shutdown Big Rock Point facility maintains its NRC site specific statutory
nuclear liability insurance requirement limit of $44.4 million.

  

Currently, 97 nuclear reactors are participating in the Secondary Financial
Protection program that provides approximately $13 billion in secondary layer
insurance coverage to compensate the public in the event of a nuclear power
reactor accident. The Price-Anderson Act provides that all potential liability
for a nuclear accident is limited to the amounts of insurance coverage
available under the primary and secondary layers.

  

Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana each have two licensed reactors. System
Energy has one licensed reactor (10% of Grand Gulf is owned by a non-
affiliated company (Cooperative Energy) that would share on a pro-rata basis
in any retrospective premium assessment to System Energy under the Price-
Anderson Act). The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment includes the
ownership, operation, and decommissioning of three nuclear power reactors and
the ownership of the shutdown Indian Point 1 reactor and Big Rock Point
facility. Indian Point 2 was shutdown in April 2020 and has been defueled
successfully as of May 2020. Indian Point 3 and Palisades are scheduled for
shutdown in April 2021 and May 2022, respectively. The Entergy Wholesale
Commodities segment previously included two nuclear power reactors that were
sold in 2019. Vermont Yankee was sold in January 2019 and Pilgrim was sold in
August 2019.

  

Property Insurance

  

Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries are members of NEIL, a mutual
insurance company that provides property damage coverage, including
decontamination and reactor stabilization, to the members’ nuclear generating
plants. The property damage insurance limits procured by Entergy for its
Utility plants and Entergy Wholesale Commodity plants are in compliance with
the financial protection requirements of the NRC.

  

The Utility plants’ (ANO 1 and 2, Grand Gulf, River Bend, and Waterford 3)
property damage insurance limits are $1.5 billion per occurrence at each plant
with an additional $100 million per nuclear property occurrence that is shared
among the plants. Property damage from earth movement is excluded from the
first $500 million in coverage for all Utility plants. Property damage from
flood is excluded from the first $500 million in coverage at ANO 1 and 2 and
Grand Gulf. Property damage from flood for Waterford 3 and River Bend includes
a deductible of $10 million plus an additional 10% of the amount of the loss
in excess of $10 million, up to a maximum deductible of $50 million. Property
damage from wind for all of the Utility nuclear plants includes a deductible
of $10 million plus an additional 10% of the amount of the loss in excess of
$10 million, up to a total maximum deductible of $50 million.

  

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ plants (Palisades, Indian Point 2, Indian
Point 3, and Big Rock Point) have property damage insurance limits as follows:
Big Rock Point - $50 million per occurrence; Palisades - $1.115 billion per
occurrence; and Indian Point - $1.06 billion per occurrence. For losses that
are considered non-nuclear in nature, the property damage insurance limit at
Palisades and Indian Point is $500 million. Property damage from wind and
flood at Indian Point includes a deductible of $10 million plus an additional
10% of the amount of the loss in excess of $10 million, up to a maximum
deductible of $50 million, and property damage from earth movement at Indian
Point is excluded. Property damage from wind, flood, and earth movement at
Palisades includes a deductible

149

of $10 million plus an additional 10% of the amount of the loss in excess of
$10 million, up to a maximum deductible of $50 million. Property damage from
wind, flood, and earth movement at Big Rock Point includes a deductible of $10
million plus an additional 10% of the amount of the loss in excess of $10
million, up to a maximum deductible of $14 million.

  

The valuation basis of the insured property at Palisades and Indian Point have
been changed from replacement cost to actual cash value, given the sites’
ages, anticipated ownership horizon and/or shutdown status.

  

In addition, Waterford 3 and Grand Gulf are also covered under NEIL’s
Accidental Outage Coverage program. Due to Entergy’s gradual exit from the
merchant/wholesale power business, Entergy no longer purchases Accidental
Outage Coverage for its non-regulated, non-generation assets. Accidental
outage coverage provides indemnification for the actual cost incurred in the
event of an unplanned outage resulting from property damage covered under the
NEIL Primary Property Insurance policy, subject to a deductible period. The
indemnification for the actual cost incurred is based on market power prices
at the time of the loss. After the deductible period has passed, weekly
indemnities for an unplanned outage, covered under NEIL’s Accidental Outage
Coverage program, would be paid according to the amounts listed below:

  

•100% of the weekly indemnity for each week for the first payment period of 52
weeks; then

•80% of the weekly indemnity for each week for the second payment period of 52
weeks; and thereafter

•80% of the weekly indemnity for an additional 58 weeks for the third and
final payment period.

  

Under the property damage and accidental outage insurance programs, all NEIL
insured plants could be subject to assessments should losses exceed the
accumulated funds available from NEIL. Effective April 1, 2020, the maximum
amounts of such possible assessments per occurrence were as follows:

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Assessments |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|Utility: |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Arkansas | $29.6 |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Louisiana | $51.8 |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Mississippi | $0.11 |  |  |  | |
|Entergy New Orleans | $0.11 |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Texas | N/A |  |  |  | |
|System Energy | $22.4 |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Wholesale Commodities | $— |  |  |  | |
  
  

Potential assessments for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants are covered
by insurance obtained through NEIL’s reinsurers.

  

NRC regulations provide that the proceeds of this insurance must be used,
first, to render the reactor safe and stable, and second, to complete
decontamination operations. Only after proceeds are dedicated for such use and
regulatory approval is secured would any remaining proceeds be made available
for the benefit of plant owners or their creditors.

  

In the event that one or more acts of terrorism causes property damage under
one or more or all nuclear insurance policies issued by NEIL (including, but
not limited to, those described above) within 12 months from the date the
first property damage occurs, the maximum recovery under all such nuclear
insurance policies shall be an aggregate not exceeding $3.24 billion plus the
additional amounts recovered for such losses from reinsurance, indemnity, and
any other sources applicable to such losses.

Non-Nuclear Property Insurance

  

Entergy’s non-nuclear property insurance program provides coverage on a
system-wide basis for Entergy’s non-nuclear assets. The insurance program
provides coverage for property damage up to $400 million per occurrence in
excess of a $20 million self-insured retention except for property damage
caused by the following: earthquake shock, flood, and named windstorm,
including associated storm surge. For earthquake shock and flood, the
insurance program provides coverage up to $400 million on an annual aggregate
basis in excess of a $40 million self-insured retention. For named windstorm
and associated storm surge, the insurance program provides coverage up to $125
million on an annual aggregate basis in excess of a $40 million self-insured
retention. The coverage provided by the insurance program for the Entergy New
Orleans gas distribution system is limited to $50 million per occurrence and
is subject to the same annual aggregate limits and retentions listed above for
earthquake shock, flood, and named windstorm, including associated storm
surge.

  

Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities,
inventories, and gas distribution-related properties. Excluded property
generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles, and towers. For
substations valued at $5 million or less, coverage for named windstorm and
associated storm surge is excluded. This coverage is in place for Entergy
Corporation, the Registrant Subsidiaries, and certain other Entergy
subsidiaries. Entergy also purchases $300 million in terrorism insurance
coverage for its conventional property. The Terrorism Risk Insurance
Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up
to $100 billion in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist
event. Under current law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act extends through
2027.

  

Employment and Labor-related Proceedings

  

The Registrant Subsidiaries and other Entergy subsidiaries are responding to
various lawsuits in both state and federal courts and to other labor-related
proceedings filed by current and former employees, recognized bargaining
representatives, and certain third parties. Generally, the amount of damages
being sought is not specified in these proceedings. These actions include, but
are not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes
and other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts;
claims of race, gender, age, and disability discrimination; disputes arising
under collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and
other administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board or
concerning the National Labor Relations Act; claims of retaliation; claims of
harassment and hostile work environment; and claims for or regarding benefits
under various Entergy Corporation-sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries are responding to these lawsuits and proceedings and deny
liability to the claimants. Management believes that loss exposure has been
and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position,
results of operation, or cash flows of Entergy or the Utility operating
companies.

  

Asbestos Litigation (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans,
and Entergy Texas)

  

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in state courts against primarily Entergy
Texas and Entergy Louisiana by individuals alleging exposure to asbestos while
working at Entergy facilities between 1955 and 1980. Entergy is being sued as
a premises owner. Many other defendants are named in these lawsuits as well.
Currently, there are approximately 200 lawsuits involving approximately 350
claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been established
to cover any exposure. Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to
recover reimbursements. Management believes that loss exposure has been and
will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position, results of
operation, or cash flows of the Utility operating companies.

Grand Gulf - Related Agreements

  

Unit Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

  

System Energy has agreed to sell all of its share of capacity and energy from
Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans in accordance with specified percentages (Entergy
Arkansas-36%, Entergy Louisiana-14%, Entergy Mississippi-33%, and Entergy New
Orleans-17%) as ordered by the FERC. Charges under this agreement are paid in
consideration for the purchasing companies’ respective entitlement to receive
capacity and energy and are payable irrespective of the quantity of energy
delivered. The agreement will remain in effect until terminated by the parties
and the termination is approved by the FERC, most likely upon Grand Gulf’s
retirement from service. In December 2016 the NRC granted the extension of
Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2044. Monthly obligations are based on
actual capacity and energy costs. The average monthly payments for 2020 under
the agreement were approximately $15.7 million for Entergy Arkansas, $6.3
million for Entergy Louisiana, $13.8 million for Entergy Mississippi, and $7.6
million for Entergy New Orleans. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
discussion of the complaints filed with the FERC against System Energy seeking
a reduction in the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales
Agreement.

  

Availability Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans are individually obligated to make payments or subordinated advances
to System Energy in accordance with stated percentages (Entergy
Arkansas-17.1%, Entergy Louisiana-26.9%, Entergy Mississippi-31.3%, and
Entergy New Orleans-24.7%) in amounts that, when added to amounts received
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement or otherwise, are adequate to cover all
of System Energy’s operating expenses as defined, including an amount
sufficient to amortize the cost of Grand Gulf 2 over 27 years (See
Reallocation Agreement terms below) and expenses incurred in connection with a
permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf. System Energy has assigned its rights to
payments and advances to certain creditors as security for certain
obligations. Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under
the Unit Power Sales Agreement have exceeded the amounts payable under the
Availability Agreement. Accordingly, no payments under the Availability
Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi
fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is
unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New
Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its
creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the
assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power
Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments.

  

Reallocation Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

  

System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans entered into the Reallocation Agreement relating to the
sale of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf and the related costs, in which
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans agreed to
assume all of Entergy Arkansas’s responsibilities and obligations with respect
to Grand Gulf under the Availability Agreement. The FERC’s decision allocating
a portion of Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas supersedes the
Reallocation Agreement as it relates to Grand Gulf. Responsibility for any
Grand Gulf 2 amortization amounts has been individually allocated (Entergy
Louisiana-26.23%, Entergy Mississippi-43.97%, and Entergy New Orleans-29.80%)
under the terms of the Reallocation Agreement. However, the Reallocation
Agreement does not affect Entergy Arkansas’s obligation to System Energy’s
lenders under the assignments referred to in the preceding paragraph. Entergy
Arkansas would be liable for its share of such amounts if Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans were unable to meet their
contractual obligations. No payments of any

152

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

  

amortization amounts will be required so long as amounts paid to System Energy
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, including other funds available to
System Energy, exceed amounts required under the Availability Agreement, which
is expected to be the case for the foreseeable future.

  

  

NOTE 9. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas,
and System Energy)

  

Accounting standards require companies to record liabilities for all legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the normal operation of the assets. For Entergy, substantially all of its
asset retirement obligations consist of its liability for decommissioning its
nuclear power plants. In addition, an insignificant amount of removal costs
associated with non-nuclear power plants is also included in the
decommissioning and asset retirement costs line item on the balance sheets.

  

These liabilities are recorded at their fair values (which are the present
values of the estimated future cash outflows) in the period in which they are
incurred, with an accompanying addition to the recorded cost of the long-lived
asset. The asset retirement obligation is accreted each year through a charge
to expense, to reflect the time value of money for this present value
obligation. The accretion will continue through the completion of the asset
retirement activity. The amounts added to the carrying amounts of the long-
lived assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets. The
application of accounting standards related to asset retirement obligations is
earnings neutral to the rate-regulated business of the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

  

In accordance with ratemaking treatment and as required by regulatory
accounting standards, the depreciation provisions for the Registrant
Subsidiaries include a component for removal costs that are not asset
retirement obligations under accounting standards. In accordance with
regulatory accounting principles, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded
regulatory assets (liabilities) in the following amounts to reflect their
estimates of the difference between estimated incurred removal costs and
estimated removal costs expected to be recovered in rates:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

|System Energy | $92.9 |  | $75.9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

As of December 31, 2020 the regulatory asset for removal costs for the Utility
operating companies includes amounts related to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane
Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration costs.

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

  

Entergy periodically reviews and updates estimated decommissioning costs. The
actual decommissioning costs may vary from the estimates because of the timing
of plant decommissioning, regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and
increased costs of labor, materials, and equipment. As described below, during
2019 and 2018, Entergy updated decommissioning cost estimates for certain
nuclear power plants. Entergy did not update decommissioning cost estimates in
2020.

  

Utility

  

In the first quarter 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its
estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and ANO 2 as a result of
a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimates resulted in a
$126.2 million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with
corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will
be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.

  

In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its
estimated decommissioning cost liability for Waterford 3 as a result of a
revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $147.5
million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a
corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be
depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

  

Pilgrim

  

Entergy Nuclear Generation Company filed its Post-Shutdown Decommissioning
Activities report (PSDAR) with the NRC in the fourth quarter 2018 for the
Pilgrim plant in anticipation of its May 2019 shutdown. As part of the
development of the PSDAR, Entergy obtained a revised decommissioning cost
study in the third quarter 2018. The revised estimate resulted in a $117.5
million increase in the decommissioning cost liability and a corresponding
impairment charge.

  

Vermont Yankee

  

In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a revision
to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Vermont Yankee. The
revised estimate resulted in a $293 million increase in the decommissioning
cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset
retirement cost asset. The revision was prompted by the progress of the
Vermont Yankee sales transaction, which is described in Note 14 to the
financial statements. Entergy accordingly evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset
retirement obligation in light of the terms of the sale transaction, upon
determining that Vermont Yankee was in held for sale status. Based on the
terms of the sales agreement, which include Entergy receiving a note
receivable from the purchaser, Entergy determined that $165 million of the
asset retirement cost was impaired, and it was accordingly written down in the
fourth quarter 2018. The Vermont Yankee plant was sold to NorthStar in January
2019.

  

NRC Filings Regarding Trust Funding Levels

  

Plant owners are required to provide the NRC with a biennial report (annually
for units that have shut down or will shut down within five years), based on
values as of December 31, addressing the owners’ ability to meet the NRC
minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds, plant
owners may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees
through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional
contributions to the trusts, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded
and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met.

  

As nuclear plants individually approach and begin decommissioning, filings
will be submitted to the NRC for planned shutdown activities. These filings
with the NRC also determine whether financial assurance may be required in
addition to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

  

Coal Combustion Residuals

  

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals
(CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs
destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface
impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program
of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C; or (2) regulating
CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-
hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA. Under both options, CCRs that are
beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous
waste regulation. In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the
material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-
hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D. The final regulations create
new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and
reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure
criteria. Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at
its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for
beneficial reuse. In December 2016 the Water Infrastructure Improvements for
the Nation Act (WIIN Act) was signed into law, which authorizes states to
regulate coal ash rather than leaving primary enforcement to citizen suit
actions. States may submit to the EPA proposals for permit programs.

NOTE 10. LEASES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

Entergy implemented ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” effective January 1,
2019. The ASU’s core principle is that “a lessee should recognize the assets
and liabilities that arise from leases.” The ASU considers that “all leases
create an asset and a liability,” and accordingly requires recording the
assets and liabilities related to all leases with a term greater than 12
months. Concurrent with the implementation of ASU 2016-02, Entergy implemented
ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for
Transition to Topic 842,” which provided Entergy the option to elect not to
evaluate existing land easements that are not currently accounted for as
leases under the previous lease standard, and ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic
842): Targeted Improvements,” which intended to simplify the transition
requirement giving Entergy the option to apply the transition provisions of
the new standard at the date of adoption instead of at the earliest
comparative period. In implementing these ASUs, Entergy elected the options
provided in both ASU 2018-01 and ASU 2018-11. This accounting was applied to
all lease agreements using the modified retrospective method, which required
an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adopting the
standard as of the effective date, and when implemented with ASU 2018-11,
allowed Entergy to recognize the leased assets and liabilities on its balance
sheet beginning on January 1, 2019 without restating prior periods. In
adopting the standard in January 2019, Entergy recognized right-of-use assets
and corresponding lease liabilities totaling approximately $263 million,
including $59 million for Entergy Arkansas, $51 million for Entergy Louisiana,
$26 million for Entergy Mississippi, $7 million for Entergy New Orleans, and
$16 million for Entergy Texas. Implementation of the standards had no material
effect on consolidated net income; therefore, no adjustment to retained
earnings was recorded. The adoption of the standards had no effect on cash
flows.

  

General

  

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries held
operating and finance leases for fleet vehicles used in operations, real
estate, and aircraft. Excluded are power purchase agreements not meeting the
definition of a lease, nuclear fuel leases, and the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback
which were determined not to be leases under the accounting standards.

  

Leases have remaining terms of one year to 60 years. Real estate leases
generally include at least one five-year renewal option; however, renewal is
not typically considered reasonably certain unless Entergy or a Registrant
Subsidiary makes significant leasehold improvements or other modifications
that would hinder its ability to easily move. In certain of the lease
agreements for fleet vehicles used in operations, Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries provide residual value guarantees to the lessor. Due to the
nature of the agreements and Entergy’s continuing relationship with the
lessor, however, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries expect to renegotiate
or refinance the leases prior to conclusion of the lease. As such, Entergy and
the Registrant Subsidiaries do not believe it is probable that they will be
required to pay anything pertaining to the residual value guarantee, and the
lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are measured accordingly.

  

Entergy incurred the following total lease costs for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019:

In allocating consideration in lease contracts to the lease and non-lease
components, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries have made the accounting
policy election to combine lease and non-lease components related to fleet
vehicles used in operations, fuel storage agreements, and purchased power
agreements and to allocate the contract consideration to both lease and non-
lease components for real estate leases.

  

Following are the relevant lease disclosures from Note 10 to the financial
statements in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

  

Total 2018 rental expenses for all leases (excluding power purchase agreement
operating leases, nuclear fuel leases, and the Grand Gulf sale and leaseback
transaction) amounted to $47.8 million for Entergy.

NOTE 11. RETIREMENT, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION
PLANS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

Qualified Pension Plans

  

Entergy has eight defined benefit qualified pension plans covering
substantially all employees. The Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-
Bargaining Employees (Non-Bargaining Plan I), the Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees (Bargaining Plan I), the Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan II for Non-Bargaining Employees (Non-Bargaining
Plan II), the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Bargaining Employees,
the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III, and the Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan IV for Bargaining Employees are non-contributory final average
pay plans and provide pension benefits that are based on employees’ credited
service and compensation during employment. Non-bargaining employees whose
most recent date of hire is after June 30, 2014 but before January 1, 2021
participate in the Entergy Corporation Cash Balance Plan for Non-Bargaining
Employees (Non-Bargaining Cash Balance Plan). Certain bargaining employees
hired or rehired after June 30, 2014, or such later date provided for in their
applicable collective bargaining agreements, participate in the Entergy
Corporation Cash Balance Plan for Bargaining Employees (Bargaining Cash
Balance Plan). The Registrant Subsidiaries participate in these four plans:
Non-Bargaining Plan I, Bargaining Plan I, Non-Bargaining Cash Balance Plan,
and Bargaining Cash Balance Plan.

  

The assets of the six final average pay defined benefit qualified pension
plans are held in a master trust established by Entergy, and the assets of the
two cash balance pension plans are held in a second master trust established
by Entergy. Each pension plan has an undivided beneficial interest in each of
the investment accounts in its respective master trust that is maintained by a
trustee. Use of the master trusts permits the commingling of the trust assets
of the pension plans of Entergy Corporation and its Registrant Subsidiaries
for investment and administrative purposes. Although assets in the master
trusts are commingled, the trustee maintains supporting records for the
purpose of allocating the trust level equity in net earnings (loss) and the
administrative expenses of the investment accounts in each trust to the
various participating pension plans in that particular trust. The fair value
of the trusts’ assets is determined by the trustee and certain investment
managers. For each trust, the trustee calculates a daily earnings factor,
including realized and unrealized gains or losses, collected and accrued
income, and administrative expenses, and allocates earnings to each plan in
the master trusts on a pro rata basis.

  

Within each pension plan, the record of each Registrant Subsidiary’s
beneficial interest in the plan assets is maintained by the plan’s actuary and
is updated quarterly. Assets for each Registrant Subsidiary are increased for
investment net income and contributions, and are decreased for benefit
payments. A plan’s investment net income/loss (i.e. interest and dividends,
realized and unrealized gains and losses and expenses) is allocated to the
Registrant Subsidiaries participating in that plan based on the value of
assets for each Registrant Subsidiary at the beginning of the quarter adjusted
for contributions and benefit payments made during the quarter.

The qualified pension plans incurred actuarial losses during 2020 and 2019
primarily due to a fall in bond yields that resulted in decreases to the
discount rates used to develop the benefit obligations. These losses were
partially offset by gains resulting from the actual return on assets exceeding
the expected return on assets for both 2020 and 2019.

  

Accumulated Pension Benefit Obligation

  

The accumulated benefit obligation for Entergy’s qualified pension plans was
$8.4 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

|System Energy | $410,296 |  |  | $368,771 |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

Other Postretirement Benefits

  

Entergy also currently offers retiree medical, dental, vision, and life
insurance benefits (other postretirement benefits) for eligible retired
employees. Employees who commenced employment before July 1, 2014 and who
satisfy certain eligibility requirements (including retiring from Entergy
after a certain age and/or years of service with Entergy and immediately
commencing their Entergy pension benefit), may become eligible for other
postretirement benefits.

  

In March 2020, Entergy announced changes to its other postretirement benefits.
Effective January 1, 2021, certain retired, former non-bargaining employees
age 65 and older who are eligible for Entergy-sponsored retiree welfare
benefits, and their eligible spouses who are age 65 and older (collectively,
Medicare-eligible participants), will be eligible to participate in a new
Entergy-sponsored retiree health plan, and will no longer be eligible for
retiree coverage under the Entergy Corporation Companies’ Benefits Plus
Medical, Dental and Vision Plans. Under the new Entergy retiree health plan,
Medicare-eligible participants will be eligible to participate in a health
reimbursement arrangement which they may use towards the purchase of various
types of qualified insurance offered through a Medicare exchange provider and
for other qualified medical expenses. In accordance with accounting standards,
the effects of this change are reflected in the December 31, 2020 other
postretirement obligation. The changes affecting active bargaining unit
employees will be negotiated with the unions prior to implementation, where
necessary, and to the extent required by law.

  

Effective January 1, 1993, Entergy adopted an accounting standard requiring a
change from a cash method to an accrual method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas have received regulatory
approval to recover accrued other postretirement benefit costs through rates.
The LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana to continue the use of the pay-as-you-go
method for ratemaking purposes for postretirement benefits other than
pensions. However, the LPSC retains the flexibility to examine individual
companies’ accounting for other postretirement benefits to determine if
special exceptions to this order are warranted. Pursuant to regulatory
directives, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Texas, and System Energy contribute the other postretirement benefit
costs collected in rates into external trusts. System Energy is funding, on
behalf of Entergy Operations, other postretirement benefits associated with
Grand Gulf.

  

Trust assets contributed by participating Registrant Subsidiaries are in
master trusts, established by Entergy Corporation and maintained by a trustee.
Each participating Registrant Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest in the
trusts’ assets. The assets in the master trusts are commingled for investment
and administrative purposes. Although assets are commingled, supporting
records are maintained for the purpose of allocating the beneficial interest
in net earnings/(losses) and the administrative expenses of the investment
accounts to the various participating plans and participating Registrant
Subsidiaries. Beneficial interest in an investment account’s net income/(loss)
is comprised of interest and dividends, realized and unrealized gains and
losses, and expenses. Beneficial interest from these

investments is allocated to the plans and participating Registrant Subsidiary

The other postretirement plans incurred actuarial losses during 2020 primarily
due to a reduction in the projected Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) revenue
and a fall in bond yields that resulted in decreases to the discount rates
used to develop the benefit obligations. These losses were partially offset by
gains resulting from the actual return on assets exceeding the expected return
on assets for 2020, an update to the latest mortality projection scale
MP-2020, and favorable claims experience. The other postretirement plans
experienced actuarial gains during 2019 primarily due to the actual return on
assets exceeding the expected return on assets for 2019, favorable claims

The non-qualified pension plans incurred actuarial losses during 2020 and 2019
primarily due to a fall in bond yields that resulted in decreases to the
discount rates used to develop the benefit obligations.

Accounting for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

  

Accounting standards require an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the
funded status of its benefit plans. This is measured as the difference between
plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation. Entergy uses a December
31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement plans. Employers
are to record previously unrecognized gains and losses, prior service costs,
and any remaining transition asset or obligation (that resulted from adopting
prior pension and other postretirement benefits accounting standards) as
comprehensive income and/or as a regulatory asset reflective of the recovery
mechanism for pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the Registrant
Subsidiaries’ respective regulatory jurisdictions. For the portion of Entergy
Louisiana that is not regulated, the unrecognized prior service cost, gains
and losses, and transition asset/obligation for its pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations are recorded as other comprehensive income.
Entergy Louisiana recovers other postretirement benefit costs on a pay-as-you-
go basis and records the unrecognized prior

service cost, gains and losses, and transition obligation for its other
postretirement benefit obligation as other comprehensive income. Accounting
standards also require that changes in the funded status be recorded as other
comprehensive income and/or a regulatory asset in the period in which the
changes occur.

  

With regard to pension and other postretirement costs, Entergy calculates the
expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by
multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the market-
related value (MRV) of plan assets. In general, Entergy determines the MRV of
its pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in
of the difference between actual and expected returns and for its other
postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy generally uses fair value.

  

In accordance with ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic
715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost”, the other components of net benefit cost are
required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service
cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations and are
presented by Entergy in miscellaneous - net in other income.

  

Qualified Pension Settlement Cost

  

In 2020, year-to-date lump sum benefit payments from the Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees exceeded the sum of the Plan’s 2020
service and interest cost, resulting in a settlement cost of $36.9 million. In
accordance with accounting standards, settlement accounting requires immediate
recognition of the portion of previously unrecognized losses associated with
the settled portion of the plan’s pension liability. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas participate in the Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees and incurred settlement
costs of $21.1 million, $8.1 million, $3.4 million, and $4.3 million,
respectively. The settlement costs were included with employee labor costs and
charged to expense and capital in the same manner that labor costs were
charged. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi received
regulatory approval to defer the expense portion of the settlement costs, with
future amortization of the deferred settlement expense over the period in
which the expense otherwise would be recorded had the immediate recognition
not occurred.

  

Entergy Texas Reserve

  

In 2020, Entergy Texas elected to establish a reserve, in accordance with PUCT
regulations, for the difference between the amount recorded for pension and
other postretirement benefits expense under generally accepted accounting
principles during the first year that rates from Entergy Texas’s last general
rate proceeding were in effect, and the annual amount of actuarially
determined pension and other postretirement benefits chargeable to Entergy
Texas’s expense in 2020. The reserve amount will be evaluated in Entergy
Texas’s next base rate case proceeding and a reasonable amortization period
will be determined by the PUCT at that time. At December 31, 2020, the balance
in this reserve was approximately $3.8 million.

  

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Plans’ Assets

  

The Plan Administrator’s trust asset investment strategy is to invest the
assets in a manner whereby long-term earnings on the assets (plus cash
contributions) provide adequate funding for retiree benefit payments. The mix
of assets is based on an optimization study that identifies asset allocation
targets in order to achieve the maximum return for an acceptable level of
risk, while minimizing the expected contributions and pension and
postretirement expense.

  

In the optimization studies, the Plan Administrator formulates assumptions
about characteristics, such as expected asset class investment returns,
volatility (risk), and correlation coefficients among the various asset
classes. The future market assumptions used in the optimization study are
determined by examining historical market characteristics of the various asset
classes and making adjustments to reflect future conditions expected to
prevail over the study period.

The target asset allocation for pension adjusts dynamically based on the
pension plans’ funded status. The current targets are shown below. The
expectation is that the allocation to fixed income securities will increase as
the pension plans’ funded status increases. The following ranges were
established to produce an acceptable, economically efficient plan to manage
around the targets.

  

For postretirement assets the target and range asset allocations (as shown
below) reflect recommendations made in the latest optimization study. The
target asset allocations for postretirement assets adjust dynamically based on
the funded status of each sub-account within each trust. The current weighted
average targets shown below represent the aggregate of all targets for all
sub-accounts within all trusts.

  

Entergy’s qualified pension and postretirement weighted-average asset
allocations by asset category at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the target
asset allocation and ranges for 2020 are as follows:

  

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

In determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in
the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance,
current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market assumptions
of its investment consultant and some investment managers.

  

The expected long-term rate of return for the qualified pension plans’ assets
is based primarily on the geometric average of the historical annual
performance of a representative portfolio weighted by the target asset
allocation defined in the table above, along with other indications of
expected return on assets. The time period reflected is a long-dated period
spanning several decades.

  

The expected long-term rate of return for the non-taxable postretirement trust
assets is determined using the same methodology described above for pension
assets, but the aggregate asset allocation specific to the non-taxable
postretirement assets is used.

  

For the taxable postretirement trust assets, the investment allocation
includes tax-exempt fixed income securities. This asset allocation, in
combination with the same methodology employed to determine the expected
return for other postretirement assets (as described above), and with a
modification to reflect applicable taxes, is used to produce the expected
long-term rate of return for taxable postretirement trust assets.

  

Concentrations of Credit Risk

  

Entergy’s investment guidelines mandate the avoidance of risk concentrations.
Types of concentrations specified to be avoided include, but are not limited
to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry,

foreign country, geographic area and individual security issuance. As of
December 31, 2020, all investment managers and assets were materially in
compliance with the approved investment guidelines, therefore there were no
significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10 percent of plan assets)
of credit risk in Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan
assets.

  

Fair Value Measurements

  

Accounting standards provide the framework for measuring fair value. That
framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).

  

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

  

•Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access at the
measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset
or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis.

  

•Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or
liability at the measurement date. Assets are valued based on prices derived
by an independent party that uses inputs such as benchmark yields, reported
trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Prices are reviewed and can
be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden if it is believed
such would be more reflective of fair value. Level 2 inputs include the
following:

  

\- quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

\- quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

\- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability; or

\- inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means.

If an asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input
must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

  

•Level 3 - Level 3 refers to securities valued based on significant
unobservable inputs.

  

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, measured
at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020, and December 31,
2019, a summary of the investments held in the master trusts for Entergy’s
qualified pension and other postretirement plans in which the Registrant
Subsidiaries participate.

(a)Certain preferred stocks and certain fixed income debt securities
(corporate, government, and securitized) are stated at fair value as
determined by broker quotes.

(b)Common stocks, certain preferred stocks, and certain fixed income debt
securities (government) are stated at fair value determined by quoted market
prices.

(c)The common collective trusts hold investments in accordance with stated
objectives. The investment strategy of the trusts is to capture the growth
potential of equity markets by replicating the performance of a specified
index. Net asset value per share of common collective trusts estimate fair
value. Certain of these common collective trusts are not publicly quoted and
are valued by the fund administrators using net asset value as a practical
expedient. Accordingly, these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value
table, but are included in the total.

(d)Registered investment companies are money market mutual funds with a stable
net asset value of one dollar per share. Registered investment companies may
hold investments in domestic and international bond markets or domestic
equities and estimate fair value using net asset value per share.

(e)Certain of these registered investment companies are not publicly quoted
and are valued by the fund administrators using net asset value as a practical
expedient. Accordingly, these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value
table, but are included in the total.

(f)The other remaining assets are U.S. municipal and foreign government bonds
stated at fair value as determined by broker quotes.

(g)The unallocated insurance contract investments are recorded at contract
value, which approximates fair value. The contract value represents
contributions made under the contract, plus interest, less funds used to pay
benefits and contract expenses, and less distributions to the master trust.

Defined Contribution Plans

  

Entergy sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
(System Savings Plan). The System Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan
covering eligible employees of Entergy and certain of its subsidiaries. The
participating Entergy subsidiary makes matching contributions to the System
Savings Plan for all eligible participating employees in an amount equal to
either 70% or 100% of the participants’ basic contributions, up to 6% of their
eligible earnings per pay period. The matching contribution is allocated to
investments as directed by the employee.

  

Entergy also sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
VI (established in April 2007) and the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries VII (established in April 2007) to which matching contributions
are also made. The plans are defined contribution plans that cover eligible
employees, as defined by each plan, of Entergy and certain of its
subsidiaries.

  

Entergy also sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
VIII (established January 2021) and the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation
and Subsidiaries IX (established January 2021) to which company contributions
are made. The participating Entergy subsidiary makes matching contributions to
these defined contribution plans for all eligible participating employees in
an amount equal to 100% of the participants’ basic contributions, up to 5% of
their eligible earnings per pay period. Eligible participants may also receive
a discretionary annual company contribution up to 4% of the participant’s
eligible earnings (subject to vesting).

  

Entergy’s subsidiaries’ contributions to defined contribution plans
collectively were $63.1 million in 2020, $57.6 million in 2019, and $54.3
million in 2018. The majority of the contributions were to the System Savings
Plan.

  

The Registrant Subsidiaries’ 2020, 2019, and 2018 contributions to defined
contribution plans for their employees were as follows:

(2019 Plan). The maximum number of common shares that can be issued from the
2019 Plan for stock-based awards is 7,300,000 all of which are available for
incentive stock option grants. The 2019 Plan applies to awards granted on or
after May 3, 2019 and awards expire ten years from the date of grant. As of
December 31, 2020, there were 6,108,451 authorized shares remaining for stock-
based awards.

  

Stock Options

  

Stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the closing market
price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant. Generally,
stock options granted will become exercisable in equal amounts on each of the
first three anniversaries of the date of grant. Unless they are forfeited
previously under the terms of the grant, options expire 10 years after the
date of the grant if they are not exercised.

  

The following table includes financial information for stock options for each
of the years presented:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

|Compensation expense included in Entergy’s consolidated net income | $3.9 |  | $3.8 |  | $4.3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Tax benefit recognized in Entergy’s consolidated net income | $1.0 |  | $1.0 |  | $1.1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Compensation cost capitalized as part of fixed assets and inventory | $1.5 |  | $1.4 |  | $0.7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy determines the fair value of the stock option grants by considering
factors such as lack of marketability, stock retention requirements, and
regulatory restrictions on exercisability in accordance with accounting
standards. The stock option weighted-average assumptions used in determining
the fair values are as follows:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|2020 |  | 2019 |  | 2018 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Stock price volatility | 17.16% |  | 17.23% |  | 17.44% |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Expected term in years | 7.04 |  | 7.32 |  | 7.33 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Risk-free interest rate | 1.49% |  | 2.50% |  | 2.54% |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Dividend yield | 4.00% |  | 4.50% |  | 4.75% |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Dividend payment per share | $3.74 |  | $3.66 |  | $3.58 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

Stock price volatility is calculated based upon the daily public stock price
volatility of Entergy Corporation common stock over a period equal to the
expected term of the award. The expected term of the options is based upon
historical option exercises and the weighted average life of options when
exercised and the estimated weighted average life of all vested but
unexercised options. In 2008, Entergy implemented stock ownership guidelines
for its senior executive officers. These guidelines require an executive
officer to own shares of Entergy Corporation common stock equal to a specified
multiple of his or her salary. Until an executive officer achieves this
ownership position the executive officer is required to retain 75% of the net-

three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance
period on the number of performance units earned. The Long-Term Performance

be earned. Entergy measures performance by assessing Entergy’s total
shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies

units under the 2019 Plan. The performance units were granted on January 30,

factors, primarily market conditions; and twenty percent were valued at
$131.72 per share, the closing price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock on

common stock, are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon
vesting, and are expensed ratably over the 3-year vesting period, and
compensation cost for the portion of the award based on cumulative adjusted
earnings per share will be adjusted based on the number of units that
ultimately vest.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is sometimes referred to as the
“competitive businesses.” Eliminations are primarily intersegment activity.
Almost all of Entergy’s goodwill is related to the Utility segment.

  

In January 2019, Entergy sold the Vermont Yankee plant, which it had
previously shut down, to NorthStar. In August 2019, Entergy sold the Pilgrim
plant, which it had previously shut down, to Holtec. Indian Point 2 was shut
down in April 2020, and Entergy has also announced plans to shut down Indian
Point 3 in April 2021 and Palisades in May 2022, and has purchase and sale
agreements with Holtec for each of them expected to close after they are shut
down. Management expects these transactions to result in the cessation of
merchant power generation at all Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power
plants owned and operated by Entergy by 2022. Entergy will continue to have
the obligation to decommission the nuclear plants pending their sales to third
parties.

  

The decisions to shut down these plants and the related transactions resulted
in asset impairments; employee retention and severance expenses and other
benefits-related costs; and contracted economic development contributions. The
employee retention and severance expenses and other benefits-related costs and
contracted economic development contributions are included in "Other operation
and maintenance" in the consolidated income statements.

In addition, Entergy Wholesale Commodities incurred $19 million in 2020, $290
million in 2019, and $532 million in 2018 of impairment, loss on sales, and
other related charges associated with these strategic decisions and
transactions. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion
of these impairment charges.

  

Going forward, Entergy Wholesale Commodities expects to incur employee
retention and severance expenses of approximately $40 million in 2021 and
approximately $15 million in 2022 associated with these strategic
transactions.

  

Geographic Areas

  

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amount of revenue
Entergy derived from outside of the United States was insignificant. As of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, Entergy had no long-lived assets located outside
of the United States.

  

Registrant Subsidiaries

  

Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries has one reportable segment, which is an
integrated utility business, except for System Energy, which is an electricity
generation business. Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ operations is
managed on an integrated basis by that company because of the substantial
effect of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process,
cost structures, and operating results.

Acquisitions

  

Choctaw Generating Station

  

In October 2019, Entergy Mississippi purchased the Choctaw Generating Station,
an 810 MW natural gas fired combined-cycle turbine plant located near French
Camp, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc. The purchase price
for the Choctaw Generating Station was approximately $305 million.

Washington Parish Energy Center

  

In April 2017, Entergy Louisiana entered into an agreement with a subsidiary
of Calpine Corporation for the construction and purchase of Washington Parish
Energy Center, which consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine
units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 361 MW. In November 2020,
Entergy Louisiana completed the purchase, as approved by the LPSC, of the
Washington Parish Energy Center. The total investment including transmission
and other related costs, is approximately $261 million, including a payment of
$222 million to purchase the plant.

  

Dispositions

  

Pilgrim

  

In July 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Holtec
International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary 100% of the equity interests in
Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, the owner of the Pilgrim plant. In August
2019 the NRC approved the sale of the plant to Holtec. The transaction closed
in August 2019 for a purchase price of $1,000 (subject to adjustments for net
liabilities and other amounts). The sale included the transfer of the Pilgrim
nuclear decommissioning trust and the asset retirement obligation for spent
fuel management and plant decommissioning. The transaction resulted in a loss
of $190 million ($156 million net-of-tax) in the third quarter 2019. The
disposition-date fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund was
approximately $1,030 million and the disposition-date fair value of the asset
retirement obligation was $837 million. The transaction also included
property, plant, and equipment with a net book value of zero, materials and
supplies, and prepaid assets.

  

Willow Glen

  

In December 2018, Entergy Louisiana sold the Willow Glen Power Station, a non-
operating gas plant. Entergy Louisiana sold Willow Glen for approximately $12
million in cash and the transfer of the obligation to decommission the plant.
Entergy Louisiana recognized a regulatory liability of $5.7 million for return
of removal costs previously collected in rates. Entergy Louisiana realized a
pre-tax gain of $14.8 million on the sale. Entergy Louisiana recorded a $31.9
million regulatory liability to recognize the obligation to refund excess
customer collections for decommissioning Willow Glen.

  

Vermont Yankee

  

In November 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell 100% of the
membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC to a subsidiary of
NorthStar. Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee was the owner of the Vermont Yankee
plant. The sale of Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee to NorthStar included the
transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the asset retirement
obligation for the spent fuel management and decommissioning of the plant.

  

In March 2018, Entergy and NorthStar entered into a settlement agreement and a
Memorandum of Understanding with State of Vermont agencies and other
interested parties that set forth the terms on which the agencies and parties
support the Vermont Public Utility Commission’s approval of the transaction.
The agreements provide additional financial assurance for decommissioning,
spent fuel management and site restoration, and detail the site restoration
standards. In October 2018 the NRC issued an order approving the application
to transfer Vermont Yankee’s license to NorthStar for decommissioning. In
December 2018, the Vermont Public Utility Commission issued an order approving
the transaction consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding’s terms. On
January 11, 2019, Entergy and NorthStar closed the transaction.

  

Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee had an outstanding credit facility that was
used to pay for dry fuel storage costs. This credit facility was guaranteed by
Entergy Corporation. A subsidiary of Entergy assumed the

200

Notes to Financial Statements

  

obligations under the credit facility, which remains outstanding. At the
closing of the sale transaction, NorthStar caused Entergy Nuclear Vermont
Yankee, renamed NorthStar Vermont Yankee, to issue a $139 million promissory
note to the Entergy subsidiary that assumed the credit facility obligations.
The amount of the note included the balance outstanding on the credit
facility, as well as borrowing fees and costs incurred by Entergy in
connection with the credit facility.

  

With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont Public Utility Commission approvals
and the resolution among the parties of the significant conditions of the
sale, Entergy concluded that as of December 31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in
held for sale status. Entergy accordingly evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset
retirement obligation in light of the terms of the sale transaction and
evaluated the remaining values of the Vermont Yankee assets. These evaluations
resulted in an increase in the asset retirement obligation and $173 million of
asset impairment and related other charges in the fourth quarter 2018. See
Note 9 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the asset
retirement obligation. Upon closing of the transaction in January 2019, the
Vermont Yankee decommissioning trust, along with the decommissioning
obligation for the plant, was transferred to NorthStar. The assets and
liabilities associated with the sale of Vermont Yankee were classified as held
for sale on the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the
decommissioning trust was $532 million. As of December 31, 2018, the asset
retirement cost asset was $127 million, classified within other deferred
debits, and the asset retirement cost obligation was $568 million, classified
within other non-current liabilities.

  

The Vermont Yankee spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to NorthStar as
part of the transaction. The Vermont Yankee transaction resulted in Entergy
generating a net deferred tax asset in January 2019. The deferred tax asset
could not be fully realized by Entergy in the first quarter of 2019;
accordingly, Entergy accrued a net tax expense of $29 million on the
disposition of Vermont Yankee. The transaction also resulted in other charges
of $5.4 million ($4.2 million net-of-tax) in the first quarter 2019.

  

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

  

2018, 2019, and 2020 Impairments

  

Entergy continues to execute its strategy to shut down and sell all of the
remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet,
with planned shutdowns of Indian Point 3 by April 30, 2021 and Palisades by
May 31, 2022. The Indian Point 2 plant permanently ceased operations on April
30, 2020. The other three Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants,
FitzPatrick, Vermont Yankee, and Pilgrim, have been sold. The FitzPatrick
plant was classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2016, and subsequently
sold to Exelon in March 2017. The Vermont Yankee plant was classified as held-
for-sale at December 31, 2018, and subsequently sold to NorthStar on January
11, 2019. The Pilgrim plant was sold to Holtec International on August 26,
2019.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities incurred $19 million in 2020, $100 million in
2019, and $532 million in 2018 of impairment charges related to nuclear fuel
spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, expenditures for capital assets,
and asset retirement obligation revisions. These costs were charged to expense
as incurred as a result of the impaired fair value of the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the significantly reduced
remaining estimated operating lives associated with management’s strategy to
exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.

  

With respect to Palisades, Entergy and Consumers Energy had agreed to amend
the existing PPA so that it would terminate early, on May 31, 2018. In
September 2017, however, Entergy and Consumers Energy agreed to terminate the
PPA amendment agreement. Entergy continues to operate Palisades under the
current PPA with Consumers Energy, instead of shutting down in the fall of
2018 as previously planned. Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades plant
permanently no later than May 31, 2022. As a result of the change in expected
operating life of the Palisades plant, the expected probability-weighted
undiscounted net cash flows as of September 30, 2017 exceeded the carrying
value of the plant and related assets. Accordingly, nuclear fuel spending,
nuclear refueling

201

outage spending, and expenditures for capital assets incurred at Palisades
after September 30, 2017 are no longer charged to expense as incurred, but
recorded as assets and depreciated or amortized, subject to the typical
periodic impairment reviews prescribed in the accounting rules.

  

The impairments and other related charges are recorded as a separate line item
in Entergy’s consolidated statements of operations and are included within the
results of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment. In addition to the
impairments and other related charges, Entergy expects to incur additional
charges through mid-2022 associated with these strategic transactions. See
Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of these additional
charges.

  

2018 Pilgrim Impairment

  

The Pilgrim plant ceased operations on May 31, 2019, at the end of its current
fuel cycle. Entergy Nuclear Generation Company filed its Post-Shutdown
Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) with the NRC in the fourth quarter
2018 for the Pilgrim plant. As part of the development of the PSDAR, Entergy
obtained a revised decommissioning cost study in the third quarter 2018. The
revised estimate resulted in a $117.5 million increase in the decommissioning
cost liability and a corresponding impairment charge in the third quarter
2018. As discussed above in Dispositions, on August 26, 2019, Entergy sold the
Pilgrim plant to a Holtec International subsidiary.

  

2018 Vermont Yankee Impairment

  

As discussed above in Dispositions, on January 11, 2019, Entergy sold the
Vermont Yankee plant to NorthStar. With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont
Public Utility Commission approvals and the resolution among the parties of
the significant conditions of the sale, Entergy concluded that as of December
31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in held-for- sale status. Entergy accordingly
evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset retirement obligation in light of the terms
of the sale transaction, and evaluated the remaining values of the Vermont
Yankee assets. These evaluations resulted in $173 million of asset impairment
and related charges in the fourth quarter 2018. See Note 9 to the financial
statements for additional discussion of the revision of the asset retirement
obligation.

  

  

NOTE 15. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Texas, and System Energy)

  

Market Risk

  

In the normal course of business, Entergy is exposed to a number of market
risks. Market risk is the potential loss that Entergy may incur as a result of
changes in the market or fair value of a particular commodity or instrument.
All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are
subject to market risk including commodity price risk, equity price, and
interest rate risk. Entergy uses derivatives primarily to mitigate commodity
price risk, particularly power price and fuel price risk.

  

The Utility has limited exposure to the effects of market risk because it
operates primarily under cost-based rate regulation. To the extent approved by
their retail regulators, the Utility operating companies use derivative
instruments to hedge the exposure to price volatility inherent in their
purchased power, fuel, and gas purchased for resale costs that are recovered
from customers.

  

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is
selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale
Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells
energy and capacity in the day ahead or spot markets. In addition to its
forward physical power and gas contracts, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may
also use a combination of financial contracts, including swaps, collars, and
options, to mitigate commodity price risk. When the market price falls, the
combination of instruments

202

* * *

Table of Contents

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

  

is expected to settle in gains that offset lower revenue from generation,
which results in a more predictable cash flow.

  

Entergy’s exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors,
including the size, term, composition, and diversification of positions held,
as well as market volatility and liquidity. For instruments such as options,
the time period during which the option may be exercised and the relationship
between the current market price of the underlying instrument and the option’s
contractual strike or exercise price also affects the level of market risk. A
significant factor influencing the overall level of market risk to which
Entergy is exposed is its use of hedging techniques to mitigate such risk.
Hedging instruments and volumes are chosen based on ability to mitigate risk
associated with future energy and capacity prices; however, other
considerations are factored into hedge product and volume decisions including
corporate liquidity, corporate credit ratings, counterparty credit risk,
hedging costs, firm settlement risk, and product availability in the
marketplace. Entergy manages market risk by actively monitoring compliance
with stated risk management policies as well as monitoring the effectiveness
of its hedging policies and strategies. Entergy’s risk management policies
limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net exposure during the
stated periods. These policies, including related risk limits, are regularly
assessed to ensure their appropriateness given Entergy’s objectives.

  

Derivatives

  

Some derivative instruments are classified as cash flow hedges due to their
financial settlement provisions while others are classified as normal
purchase/normal sale transactions due to their physical settlement provisions.
Normal purchase/normal sale risk management tools include power purchase and
sales agreements, fuel purchase agreements, capacity contracts, and tolling
agreements. Financially-settled cash flow hedges can include natural gas and
electricity swaps and options and interest rate swaps. Entergy may enter into
financially-settled swap and option contracts to manage market risk that may
or may not be designated as hedging instruments.

  

Entergy enters into derivatives to manage natural risks inherent in its
physical or financial assets or liabilities. Electricity over-the-counter
instruments and futures contracts that financially settle against day-ahead
power pool prices are used to manage price exposure for Entergy Wholesale
Commodities generation. The maximum length of time over which Entergy
Wholesale Commodities is currently hedging the variability in future cash
flows with derivatives for forecasted power transactions at December 31, 2020
is approximately 3 months. Planned generation currently under contract from
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is 98% for 2021, of which
approximately 29% is sold under financial derivatives and the remainder under
normal purchase/normal sale contracts. Total planned generation for 2021 is
9.6 TWh.

  

Entergy may use standardized master netting agreements to help mitigate the
credit risk of derivative instruments. These master agreements facilitate the
netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include
collateral requirements. Cash, letters of credit, and parental/affiliate
guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to
mitigate credit risk. The collateral agreements require a counterparty to post
cash or letters of credit in the event an exposure exceeds an established
threshold. The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit, which may be
supported by a parental/affiliate guarantee, as determined in accordance with
Entergy’s credit policy. In addition, collateral agreements allow for
termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a failure or
inability to post collateral.

  

Certain of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale
Commodities power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary
to provide credit support to secure its obligations depending on the mark-to-
market values of the contracts. The primary form of credit support to satisfy
these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guarantee. As of December 31,
2020, there were no derivative contracts with counterparties in a liability
position. In addition to the corporate guarantee, $5 million in cash
collateral was required to be posted by the Entergy subsidiary to its
counterparties and $39 million in letters of credit were required to be posted
by its counterparties to the Entergy subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019,
there were no derivative contracts with counterparties in a liability
position. In addition to the corporate guarantee, $11 million in cash
collateral was

203

Notes to Financial Statements

  

  

  

  

required to be posted by the Entergy subsidiary to its counterparties and $1
million in cash collateral and $98 million in letters of credit were required
to be posted by its counterparties to the Entergy subsidiary. If the Entergy
Corporation credit rating falls below investment grade, Entergy would have to
post collateral equal to the estimated outstanding liability under the
contract at the applicable date.

  

Entergy manages fuel price volatility for its Louisiana jurisdictions (Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) and Entergy Mississippi through the
purchase of natural gas swaps and options that financially settle against
either the average Henry Hub Gas Daily prices or the NYMEX Henry Hub. These
swaps and options are marked-to-market through fuel expense with offsetting
regulatory assets or liabilities. All benefits or costs of the program are
recorded in fuel costs. The notional volumes of these swaps are based on a
portion of projected annual exposure to gas price volatility for electric
generation at Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi and projected winter
purchases for gas distribution at Entergy New Orleans. The maximum length of
time over which Entergy had executed natural gas swaps and options as of
December 31, 2020 is 3.25 years for Entergy Louisiana and the maximum length
of time over which Entergy has executed natural gas swaps as of December 31,
2020 is 10 months for Entergy Mississippi and 3 months Entergy New Orleans.
The total volume of natural gas swaps and options outstanding as of December
31, 2020 is 38,799,000 MMBtu for Entergy, including 23,720,000 MMBtu for
Entergy Louisiana, 14,573,000 MMBtu for Entergy Mississippi, and 506,000 MMBtu
for Entergy New Orleans. Credit support for these natural gas swaps and
options is covered by master agreements that do not require Entergy to provide
collateral based on mark-to-market value, but do carry adequate assurance
language that may lead to requests for collateral.

  

During the second quarter 2020, Entergy participated in the annual financial
transmission rights auction process for the MISO planning year of June 1, 2020
through May 31, 2021. Financial transmission rights are derivative instruments
that represent economic hedges of future congestion charges that will be
incurred in serving Entergy’s customer load. They are not designated as
hedging instruments. Entergy initially records financial transmission rights

The effects of Entergy’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
on the consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2020,
2019, and 2018 are as follows:

|Electricity swaps and options |  | $77 |  | Competitive business operating revenues |  | $148 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Electricity swaps and options |  | $232 |  | Competitive business operating revenues |  | $97 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|2018 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Electricity swaps and options |  | ($40) |  | Competitive business operating revenues |  | ($68) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

(a)Before taxes of $31 million, $20 million, and ($14) million, for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively

  

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Entergy measured its hedges for
ineffectiveness. Any ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings during the
period. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges was recorded in
competitive businesses operating revenues. The change in fair value of
Entergy’s cash flow hedges due to ineffectiveness was ($5.9) million for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

  

Based on market prices as of December 31, 2020, unrealized gains recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income on cash flow hedges relating to power
sales totaled $38 million of net unrealized losses. Approximately $38 million
is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to
operating revenues in the next twelve months. The actual amount reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive income, however, could vary due to future
changes in market prices.

  

Entergy may effectively liquidate a cash flow hedge instrument by entering
into a contract offsetting the original hedge, and then de-designating the
original hedge in this situation. Gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income prior to de-designation continue to be deferred in other
comprehensive income until they are included in income as the original hedged
transaction occurs. From the point of de-designation, the gains or losses on
the original hedge and the offsetting contract are recorded as assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and offset as they flow through to earnings.

and then such amounts are simultaneously reversed and recorded as an
offsetting regulatory asset or liability. The gains or losses recorded as fuel

through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.

(b)Due to regulatory treatment, the changes in the estimated fair value of
financial transmission rights for the Utility operating companies are recorded
through purchased power expense and then such amounts are simultaneously
reversed and recorded as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. The
gains or losses recorded as purchased power expense when the financial
transmission rights for the Utility operating companies are settled are
recovered or refunded through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.

(c)There were no gains (losses) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive

(a)Due to regulatory treatment, the natural gas swaps and options are marked-
to-market through fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale
and then such amounts are simultaneously reversed and recorded as an
offsetting regulatory asset or liability. The gains or losses recorded as fuel
expenses when the swaps and options are settled are recovered or refunded
through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.

  

(b)Due to regulatory treatment, the changes in the estimated fair value of
financial transmission rights for the Utility operating companies are recorded
through purchased power expense and then such amounts are simultaneously
reversed and recorded as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. The
gains or losses recorded as purchased power expense when the financial
transmission rights for the Utility operating companies are settled are
recovered or refunded through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.

  

Fair Values

  

The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives
are determined using historical prices, bid prices, market quotes, and
financial modeling. Considerable judgment is required in developing the
estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange. Gains
or losses realized on financial instruments other than those instruments held
by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are reflected in future rates
and therefore do not affect net income. Entergy considers the carrying amounts
of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to
be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.

  

Accounting standards define fair value as an exit price, or the price that
would be received to sell an asset or the amount that would be paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable market
participants at the date of measurement. Entergy and the Registrant
Subsidiaries use assumptions or market input data that market participants
would use in pricing assets or liabilities at fair value. The inputs can be
readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable.
Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries endeavor to use the best available
information to determine fair value.

  

Accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy establishes the highest
priority for unadjusted market quotes in an active market for the identical
asset or liability and the lowest priority for unobservable inputs.

  

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

  

•Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at
the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the
asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of individually
owned common stocks, cash equivalents (temporary cash investments,
securitization recovery trust account, and escrow accounts), debt instruments,
and gas swaps traded on exchanges with active markets. Cash equivalents
includes all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments with an original or
remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.

  

•Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or
liability at the measurement date. Assets are valued based on prices derived
by independent third parties that use inputs such as benchmark yields,
reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Prices are reviewed
and can be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden by
Entergy if it is believed such would be more reflective of fair value. Level 2
inputs include the following:

  

–quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

–quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

212

Notes to Financial Statements

  

–inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability; or

–inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data by correlation or other means.

  

Level 2 consists primarily of individually-owned debt instruments and gas
swaps and options valued using observable inputs.

  

•Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are pricing inputs that are generally less
observable or unobservable from objective sources. These inputs are used with
internally developed methodologies to produce management’s best estimate of
fair value for the asset or liability. Level 3 consists primarily of financial
transmission rights and derivative power contracts used as cash flow hedges of
power sales at merchant power plants.

  

The values for power contract assets or liabilities are based on both
observable inputs including public market prices and interest rates, and
unobservable inputs such as implied volatilities, unit contingent discounts,
expected basis differences, and credit adjusted counterparty interest rates.
They are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities. The valuations of these
assets and liabilities are performed by the Office of Corporate Risk Oversight
and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group. The primary related
functions of the Office of Corporate Risk Oversight include: gathering,
validating and reporting market data, providing market risk analyses and
valuations in support of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ commercial
transactions, developing and administering protocols for the management of
market risks, and implementing and maintaining controls around changes to
market data in the energy trading and risk management system. The Office of
Corporate Risk Oversight is also responsible for managing the energy trading
and risk management system, forecasting revenues, forward positions and
analysis. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group performs
functions related to market and counterparty settlements, revenue reporting
and analysis, and financial accounting. The Office of Corporate Risk Oversight
reports to the Vice President and Treasurer while the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities Accounting group reports to the Chief Accounting Officer.

  

The amounts reflected as the fair value of electricity swaps are based on the
estimated amount that the contracts are in-the-money at the balance sheet date
(treated as an asset) or out-of-the-money at the balance sheet date (treated
as a liability) and would equal the estimated amount receivable to or payable
by Entergy if the contracts were settled at that date. These derivative
contracts include cash flow hedges that swap fixed for floating cash flows for
sales of the output from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. The fair
values are based on the mark-to-market comparison between the fixed contract
prices and the floating prices determined each period from quoted forward
power market prices. The differences between the fixed price in the swap
contract and these market-related prices multiplied by the volume specified in
the contract and discounted at the counterparties’ credit adjusted risk free
rate are recorded as derivative contract assets or liabilities. For contracts
that have unit contingent terms, a further discount is applied based on the
historical relationship between contract and market prices for similar
contract terms.

  

The amounts reflected as the fair values of electricity options are valued
based on a Black Scholes model, and are calculated at the end of each month
for accounting purposes. Inputs to the valuation include end of day forward
market prices for the period when the transactions will settle, implied
volatilities based on market volatilities provided by a third-party data
aggregator, and U.S. Treasury rates for a risk-free return rate. As described
further below, prices and implied volatilities are reviewed and can be
adjusted if it is determined that there is a better representation of fair
value.

  

On a daily basis, the Office of Corporate Risk Oversight calculates the mark-
to-market for electricity swaps and options. The Office of Corporate Risk
Oversight also validates forward market prices by comparing them to other
sources of forward market prices or to settlement prices of actual market
transactions. Significant differences are analyzed and potentially adjusted
based on these other sources of forward market prices or settlement prices of
actual market transactions. Implied volatilities used to value options are
also validated using actual counterparty quotes for Entergy Wholesale
Commodities transactions when available and compared with other sources of
market

implied volatilities. Moreover, on a quarterly basis, the Office of Corporate
Risk Oversight confirms the mark-to-market calculations and prepares price
scenarios and credit downgrade scenario analysis. The scenario analysis is
communicated to senior management within Entergy and within Entergy Wholesale
Commodities. Finally, for all proposed derivative transactions, an analysis is
completed to assess the risk of adding the proposed derivative to Entergy
Wholesale Commodities’ portfolio. In particular, the credit and liquidity
effects are calculated for this analysis. This analysis is communicated to
senior management within Entergy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

  

The values of financial transmission rights are based on unobservable inputs,
including estimates of congestion costs in MISO between applicable generation
and load pricing nodes based on the 50th percentile of historical prices. They
are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities. The valuations of these
assets and liabilities are performed by the Office of Corporate Risk
Oversight. The values are calculated internally and verified against the data
published by MISO. Entergy’s Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group
review these valuations for reasonableness, with the assistance of others
within the organization with knowledge of the various inputs and assumptions
used in the valuation. The Office of Corporate Risk Oversight reports to the
Vice President and Treasurer. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting
group reports to the Chief Accounting Officer.

  

The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy,
Entergy’s assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The assessment
of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires
judgment and may affect their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels.

(a)The decommissioning trust funds hold equity and fixed income securities.
Equity securities are invested to approximate the returns of major market
indices. Fixed income securities are held in various governmental and
corporate securities. See Note 16 to the financial statements herein for
additional information on the investment portfolios.

(b)The decommissioning trust funds fair value presented herein does not
include the recognition of a credit loss valuation allowance of $0.1 million
on debt securities due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. See Note 16 to the
financial statements herein for additional information on the allowance for
expected credit losses.

(c)Common trust funds are not publicly quoted and are valued by the fund
administrators using net asset value as a practical expedient. Accordingly,
these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value table. The fund
administrator of these investments allows daily trading at the net asset value
and trades settle at a later date.

  

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the net assets
(liabilities) for the fair value of derivatives classified as Level 3 in the

calculated internally and verified against historical pricing data published
by MISO.

  

The following table sets forth an analysis of each of the types of
unobservable inputs impacting the fair value of items classified as Level 3
within the fair value hierarchy, and the sensitivity to changes to those
inputs:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

Equity securities are invested to approximate the returns of major market
indices. Fixed income securities are held in various governmental and
corporate securities. See Note 16 to the financial statements herein for
additional information on the investment portfolios.

(b)Common trust funds are not publicly quoted and are valued by the fund
administrators using net asset value as a practical expedient. Accordingly,
these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value table. The fund
administrator of these investments allows daily trading at the net asset value
and trades settle at a later date.

NOTE 16. DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

  

The NRC requires Entergy subsidiaries to maintain nuclear decommissioning
trusts to fund the costs of decommissioning ANO 1, ANO 2, River Bend,
Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and
Palisades. Entergy’s nuclear decommissioning trust funds invest in equity
securities, fixed-rate debt securities, and cash and cash equivalents.

  

Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair
value. Because of the ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover
decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment
for decommissioning trust funds, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an
offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities in
other regulatory liabilities/assets. For the 30% interest in River Bend
formerly owned by Cajun, Entergy Louisiana records an offsetting amount in
other deferred credits for the unrealized trust earnings not currently
expected to be needed to decommission the plant. Decommissioning trust funds
for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants do not meet the criteria
for regulatory accounting treatment. Accordingly, unrealized gains/(losses)
recorded on the equity securities in the trust funds are recognized in
earnings. Unrealized gains recorded on the available-for-sale debt securities
in the trust funds are recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive
income component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized losses (where cost
exceeds fair market value) on the available-for-sale debt securities in the
trust funds are also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income
component of shareholders’ equity unless the unrealized loss is other than
temporary and therefore recorded in earnings. A portion of Entergy’s
decommissioning trust funds were held in a wholly-owned registered investment
company, and unrealized gains and losses on both the equity and debt
securities held in the registered investment company were recognized in
earnings. In December 2020, Entergy liquidated its interest in the registered
investment company. Generally, Entergy records gains and losses on its debt
and equity securities using the specific identification method to determine
the cost basis of its securities.

  

The unrealized gains/(losses) recognized during the year ended December 31,
2020 on equity securities still held as of December 31, 2020 were $531
million. The equity securities are generally held in funds that are designed
to approximate or somewhat exceed the return of the Standard Poor’s 500 Index.
A relatively small percentage of the equity securities are held in funds
intended to replicate the return of the Wilshire 4500 index or the Russell
3000 Index. The debt securities are generally held in individual government
and credit issuances.

Allowance for expected credit losses

  

Entergy implemented ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January
1, 2020. In accordance with the new standard, Entergy estimates the expected
credit losses for its available for sale securities based on the current
credit rating and remaining life of the securities. To the extent an
individual security is determined to be uncollectible it is written off
against this allowance. Entergy’s available-for-sale securities are held in
trusts managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that
define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales
of investments. Specifically, available-for-sale securities are subject to
credit worthiness restrictions, with requirements for both the average credit
rating of the portfolio and minimum credit ratings for individual debt

securities. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy’s allowance for expected credit
losses related to available-for-sale securities was $0.1 million. Entergy did
not record any impairments of available-for-sale debt securities for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

  

Other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized gains and losses

  

Prior to the implementation of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, Entergy
evaluated the available-for-sale debt securities in the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear decommissioning trust funds with unrealized losses at the
end of each period to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment had
occurred. The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security suffered
an other-than-temporary impairment was based on whether Entergy had the intent
to sell or more likely than not would have been required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized costs. Further, if Entergy did not
expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an
other-than-temporary impairment was considered to have occurred and it was
measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the
amortized cost basis (credit loss). Entergy did not have any material other-
than-temporary impairments relating to credit losses on debt securities for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

  

  

NOTE 17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas,
and System Energy)

  

Under applicable authoritative accounting guidance, a variable interest entity
(VIE) is an entity that conducts a business or holds property that possesses
any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk
to finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct
the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are
disproportionate to their ownership interest), or where equity holders do not
receive expected losses or returns. An entity may have an interest in a VIE
through ownership or other contractual rights or obligations, and is required
to consolidate a VIE if it is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. The primary
beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has the power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and
has the obligation to absorb losses or has the right to residual returns that
would potentially be significant to the entity.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy consolidate the
respective companies from which they lease nuclear fuel, usually in a sale and
leaseback transaction. This is because Entergy directs the nuclear fuel
companies with respect to nuclear fuel purchases, assists the nuclear fuel
companies in obtaining financing, and, if financing cannot be arranged, the
lessee (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy) is responsible
to repurchase nuclear fuel to allow the nuclear fuel company (the VIE) to meet
its obligations. During the term of the arrangements, none of the Entergy
operating companies have been required to provide financial support apart from
their scheduled lease payments. See Note 4 to the financial statements for
details of the nuclear fuel companies’ credit facility and commercial paper
borrowings and long-term debt that are reported by Entergy, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. These amounts also represent Entergy’s
and the respective Registrant Subsidiary’s maximum exposure to losses
associated with their respective interests in the nuclear fuel companies.

  

Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC, and Entergy Texas
Restoration Funding, LLC, companies wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy
Texas, are variable interest entities and Entergy Texas is the primary
beneficiary. In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding issued
senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy
Texas’s Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs. In November 2009, Entergy Texas
Restoration Funding issued senior secured transition bonds (securitization
bonds) to finance Entergy Texas’s Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav
restoration costs. With the proceeds, the variable interest entities purchased
from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from
customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the
securitization bonds. The transition property is reflected as a regulatory
asset on the consolidated Entergy Texas balance sheet. The creditors of
Entergy Texas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of the variable
interest entities, including the transition property, and the creditors

of the variable interest entities do not have recourse to the assets or
revenues of Entergy Texas. Entergy Texas has no payment obligations to the
variable interest entities except to remit transition charge collections. See
Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the
securitization bonds.

  

Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and
consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, is a variable interest entity and Entergy
Arkansas is the primary beneficiary. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas
Restoration Funding issued storm cost recovery bonds to finance Entergy
Arkansas’s January 2009 ice storm damage restoration costs. With the proceeds,
Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding purchased from Entergy Arkansas the storm
recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through a
storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds.
The storm recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the
consolidated Entergy Arkansas balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. Although
the principal amount was not due until August 2021, Entergy Arkansas
Restoration Funding made principal payments on the bonds in 2020, after which
the bonds were fully repaid. See Note 5 to the financial statements for
additional details regarding the storm cost recovery bonds.

  

Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-
owned and consolidated by Entergy Louisiana, is a variable interest entity and
Entergy Louisiana is the primary beneficiary. In September 2011, Entergy
Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding issued investment recovery bonds to
recover Entergy Louisiana’s investment recovery costs associated with the
canceled Little Gypsy repowering project. With the proceeds, Entergy Louisiana
Investment Recovery Funding purchased from Entergy Louisiana the investment
recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through an
investment recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the bonds. The
investment recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the
consolidated Entergy Louisiana balance sheet. The creditors of Entergy
Louisiana do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana
Investment Recovery Funding, including the investment recovery property, and
the creditors of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding do not have
recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana has
no payment obligations to Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding except
to remit investment recovery charge collections. See Note 5 to the financial
statements for additional details regarding the investment recovery bonds.

  

Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-owned
and consolidated by Entergy New Orleans, is a variable interest entity, and
Entergy New Orleans is the primary beneficiary. In July 2015, Entergy New
Orleans Storm Recovery Funding issued storm cost recovery bonds to recover
Entergy New Orleans’s Hurricane Isaac storm restoration costs, including
carrying costs, the costs of funding and replenishing the storm recovery
reserve, and up-front financing costs associated with the securitization. With
the proceeds, Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding purchased from
Entergy New Orleans the storm recovery property, which is the right to recover
from customers through a storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service
the securitization bonds. The storm recovery property is reflected as a
regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy New Orleans balance sheet. The
creditors of Entergy New Orleans do not have recourse to the assets or
revenues of Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding, including the storm
recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery
Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy New Orleans.
Entergy New Orleans has no payment obligations to Entergy New Orleans Storm
Recovery Funding except to remit storm recovery charge collections. See Note 5
to the financial statements for additional details regarding the
securitization bonds.

  

System Energy is considered to hold a variable interest in the lessor from
which it leases an undivided interest in the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. System
Energy is the lessee under this arrangement, which is described in more detail
in Note 5 to the financial statements. System Energy made payments on its
lease, including interest, of $17.2 million in 2020, $17.2 million in 2019,
and $17.2 million in 2018. The lessor is a bank acting in the capacity of
owner trustee for the benefit of equity investors in the transaction pursuant
to trust agreement entered solely for the purpose of facilitating the lease
transaction. It is possible that System Energy may be considered as the
primary beneficiary of the lessor, but it is unable to apply the authoritative
accounting guidance with respect to this VIE because the lessor is not
required to, and could not, provide the necessary financial information to
consolidate the

lessor. Because System Energy accounts for this leasing arrangement as a
capital financing, however, System Energy believes that consolidating the
lessor would not materially affect the financial statements. In the unlikely
event of default under a lease, remedies available to the lessor include
payment by the lessee of the fair value of the undivided interest in the
plant, payment of the present value of the basic rent payments, or payment of
a predetermined casualty value. System Energy believes, however, that the
obligations recorded on the balance sheet materially represent its potential
exposure to loss.

  

Entergy has also reviewed various lease arrangements, power purchase
agreements, including agreements for renewable power, and other agreements
that represent variable interests in other legal entities which have been
determined to be variable interest entities. In these cases, Entergy has
determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the related VIE because
it does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, or it does not have the
obligation to absorb losses or the right to residual returns that would
potentially be significant to the entity, or both.

  

NOTE 18. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

Each Registrant Subsidiary purchases electricity from or sells electricity to

(a)Sales for resale and competitive businesses sales include day-ahead sales
of energy in a market administered by an ISO. These sales represent
financially binding commitments for the sale of physical energy the next day.
These sales are adjusted to actual power generated and delivered in the real
time market. Given the short duration of these transactions, Entergy does not
consider them to be derivatives subject to fair value adjustments, and
includes them as part of customer revenues.

(b)Other electric revenues consist primarily of transmission and ancillary
services provided to participants of an ISO-administered market and unbilled
revenue.

(c)Other revenues include the settlement of financial hedges, occasional sales
of inventory, alternative revenue programs, provisions for revenue subject to
refund, and late fees.

  

Electric Revenues

  

Entergy’s primary source of revenue is from retail electric sales sold under
tariff rates approved by regulators in its various jurisdictions. Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and
Entergy Texas generate, transmit, and distribute electric power primarily to
retail customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy’s
Utility operating companies provide power to customers on demand throughout
the month, measured by a meter located at the customer’s property. Approved
rates vary by customer class due to differing requirements of the customers
and market factors involved in fulfilling those requirements. Entergy issues
monthly bills to customers at rates approved by regulators for power and
related services provided during the previous billing cycle.

  

To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued,
Entergy’s Utility operating companies record an estimate for energy delivered
since the latest billings. The Utility operating companies calculate the
estimate based upon several factors including billings through the last
billing cycle in a month, actual generation in the month, historical line loss
factors, and market prices of power in the respective jurisdiction. The inputs
are revised as needed to approximate actual usage and cost. Each month,
estimated unbilled amounts are recorded as unbilled revenue and accounts
receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. Price and volume
differences resulting from factors such as weather affect the calculation of
unbilled revenues from one period to the other.

  

Entergy may record revenue based on rates that are subject to refund. Such
revenues are reduced by estimated refund amounts when Entergy believes refunds
are probable based on the status of rate proceedings as of the date financial
statements are prepared. Because these refunds will be made through a
reduction in future rates, and not as a reduction in bills previously issued,
they are presented as other revenues in the table above.

  

System Energy’s only source of revenue is the sale of electric power and
capacity generated from its 90% interest in the Grand Gulf nuclear plant to
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans. System Energy issues monthly bills to its affiliated customers equal
to its actual operating costs plus a return on common equity approved by the
FERC.

  

Entergy’s Utility operating companies also sell excess power not needed for
its own customers, primarily through transactions with MISO, a regional
transmission organization that maintains functional control over the combined
transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy
markets in the U.S. In the MISO market, Entergy offers its generation and bids
its load into the market. MISO settles these offers and bids based on
locational marginal prices. These represent pricing for energy at a given
location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical
limitations on the transmission system, generation, and demand throughout the
MISO region. MISO evaluates each market participant’s energy offers and demand
bids to economically and reliably dispatch the entire MISO system. Entergy
nets purchases and sales within the MISO market and reports in operating
revenues when in a net selling position and in operating expenses when in a
net purchasing position.

  

Natural Gas

  

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also distribute natural gas to
retail customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans,
Louisiana, respectively. Gas transferred to customers is measured by a meter
at the customer’s property. Entergy issues monthly invoices to customers at
rates approved by regulators for the volume of gas transferred to date.

Competitive Businesses Revenues

  

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment derives almost all of its revenue
from sales of electric power and capacity produced by its operating plants to
wholesale customers. The majority of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues
are from Entergy’s nuclear power plants located in the northern United States.
Entergy issues monthly invoices to the counterparties for these electric sales
at the respective contracted or ISO market rate of electricity and related
services provided during the previous month.

  

Almost all of the Palisades nuclear plant output is sold under a 15-year PPA
with Consumers Energy, executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in
2007 and expiring in April 2022. Prices under the original PPA range from
$43.50/MWh in 2007 to $61.50/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA
is $51/MWh. Entergy executed an additional PPA to cover the period from the
expiration of the original PPA through final shutdown in May 2022, at a price
of $24.14/MWh. Entergy issues monthly invoices to Consumers Energy for
electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services
provided during the previous month at the contract price. The PPA was at
below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and Entergy amortizes a
liability to revenue over the life of the agreement. The amount amortized each
period is based upon the present value, calculated at the date of acquisition,
of each year’s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue
based on estimated market prices. Amounts amortized to revenue were $11
million in 2020, $10 million in 2019, and $6 million in 2018. Amounts to be
amortized to revenue through the remaining life of the agreement will be
approximately $12 million in 2021 and $5 million in 2022.

  

Practical Expedients and Exceptions

  

Entergy has elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
obligations for contracts with an original expected term of one year or less,
or for revenue recognized in an amount equal to what Entergy has the right to
bill the customer for services performed.

  

Most of Entergy’s contracts, except in a few cases where there are defined
minimums or stated terms, are on demand. This results in customer bills that
vary each month based on an approved tariff and usage. Entergy imposes monthly
or annual minimum requirements on some customers primarily as credit and cost
recovery guarantees and not as pricing for unsatisfied performance
obligations. These minimums typically expire after the initial term or when
specified costs have been recovered. The minimum amounts are part of each
month’s bill and recognized as revenue accordingly. Some of the subsidiaries
within the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment have operations and
maintenance services contracts that have fixed components and terms longer
than one year. The total fixed consideration related to these unsatisfied
performance obligations, however, is not material to Entergy revenues.

  

Recovery of Fuel Costs

  

Entergy’s Utility operating companies’ rate schedules include either fuel
adjustment clauses or fixed fuel factors, which allow either current recovery
in billings to customers or deferral of fuel costs until the costs are billed
to customers. Where the fuel component of revenues is based on a pre-
determined fuel cost (fixed fuel factor), the fuel factor remains in effect
until changed as part of a general rate case, fuel reconciliation, or fixed
fuel factor filing. System Energy’s operating revenues are intended to recover
from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans operating expenses and capital costs attributable to Grand Gulf. The
capital costs are based on System Energy’s common equity funds allocable to
its net investment in Grand Gulf, plus System Energy’s effective interest cost
for its debt allocable to its investment in Grand Gulf.

  

Taxes Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions

  

Governmental authorities assess taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer,
including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, and

234

some excise taxes. Entergy presents these taxes on a net basis, excluding them
from revenues.

  

Allowance for doubtful accounts

  

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects Entergy’s best estimate of
expected losses on its accounts receivable balances. Due to the essential
nature of utility services, Entergy has historically experienced a low rate of
default on its accounts receivables. Due to the effect of the COVID-19
pandemic on customer receivables, however, Entergy recorded an increase in its
allowance for doubtful accounts, as shown below:

Mississippi, $12.2 million for Entergy New Orleans, and $12.9 million for
Entergy Texas that have been deferred as regulatory assets. See Note 2 to the

The allowance for currently expected credit losses is calculated as the
historical rate of customer write-offs multiplied by the current accounts
receivable balance, taking into account the length of time the receivable
balances have been outstanding. Although the rate of customer write-offs has
historically experienced minimal variation, management monitors the current
condition of individual customer accounts to manage collections and ensure bad
debt expense is recorded in a timely manner.

Results of operations for 2020 include resolution of the 2014-2015 IRS audit,
which resulted in a reduction in deferred income tax expense of $230 million
that includes a $396 million reduction in deferred income tax expense at
Utility related to the basis of assets contributed in the 2015 Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana business combination, including
the recognition of previously uncertain tax positions, and deferred income tax
expense of $105 million at Entergy Wholesale Commodities and $61 million at
Parent and Other resulting from the revaluation of net operating losses as a
result of the release of the reserves. See Note 3 to the financial statements
for further discussion of the IRS audit resolution.

  

Results of operations for 2019 include: 1) a loss of $190 million ($156
million net-of-tax) as a result of the sale of the Pilgrim plant in August
2019; 2) a $156 million reduction in income tax expense recognized by Entergy
Wholesale Commodities as a result of an internal restructuring; and 3)
impairment charges of $100 million ($79 million net-of-tax) due to costs being
charged directly to expense as incurred as a result of the impaired value of
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the
significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with
management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant
power business. See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion
of the internal restructuring. See Note 14 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the sale of the Pilgrim plant.

affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy and affect
its financial results. Carefully consider all of the information in this
report and, in particular, the following principal risks and all of the other
specific factors described in Item 1A. of this report, “Risk Factors,” before
deciding whether to invest in Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

  

Utility Regulatory Risks

  

•The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted.

•The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the
Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through
regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal,
potentially resulting in lengthy litigation and uncertainty as to ultimate
results.

•The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated
costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or
disallowance in regulatory proceedings.

•Entergy’s business could experience adverse effects related to changes to

General Business Risks

  

•Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital
markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could
make it more difficult to handle future contingencies. Disruptions in the
capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy’s and its
subsidiaries’ ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and
grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.

•A downgrade in Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings
could, among other things, negatively affect Entergy Corporation’s and its
subsidiaries’ ability to access capital.

•Changes in tax legislation and taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in
quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively
impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

•Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to successfully execute on their
business strategies, including their ability to complete capital projects,
other capital improvements, and strategic transactions is subject to
significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all
of the anticipated results of such strategies.

•Failure to attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce
could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries’ results of operations.

•The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business may incur substantial costs (i) to fulfill their
obligations related to environmental and other matters or (ii) related to
reliability standards.

•Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors
may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise
materially affect the Utility operating companies’ results of operations.

•Entergy could be negatively affected by the effects of climate change and
environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas
emission reductions or increase clean or renewable energy requirements or to
place a price on greenhouse gas emissions.

•Entergy is dependent on the continued and future availability and quality of
water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses.

•Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in
commodity prices.

•The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities
business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their
obligations.

•Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan
assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased
benefit plan costs.

•The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy
subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.

•Terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures, or data breaches of
Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ or its suppliers’ technology systems may
adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations.

•The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas
service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans’s results of operations and
liquidity.

•System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear
generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for
all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System
Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of
ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings.

•As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from
its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and
to pay dividends on its common stock.

ENTERGY’S BUSINESS

  

Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power
production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power
plants with approximately 30,000 MW of electric generating capacity, including
approximately 8,000 MW of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 3.0
million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.
Entergy had annual revenues of $10.1 billion in 2020 and had more than 13,000
employees as of December 31, 2020.

  

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities.

  

•The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission,
distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi,
Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a
small natural gas distribution business.

•The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership,
operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern
United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating
plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides
services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear
power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to
wholesale customers. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business” for
discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and sale of each of the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.

  

See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding
Entergy’s business segments.

  

Strategy

  

Entergy’s strategy is to operate and grow the premier utility business that
creates sustainable value for its customers, employees, communities, and
owners. Entergy’s strategy to achieve its stakeholder objectives has two key
aspects. First, Entergy invests in the Utility for the benefit of its
customers, which supports steady, predictable growth in earnings and
dividends. Second, Entergy manages risks by ensuring its Utility investments
are customer-centric, supported by progressive regulatory constructs, and
executed with disciplined project management. Entergy’s strategy for the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment is to continue to manage the
risk of its operating portfolio as Entergy completes its exit from the
merchant power business.

  

Utility

  

The Utility business segment includes five retail electric utility
subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas. These companies generate, transmit,
distribute, and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New
Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively. Also
included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy
Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf. System Energy sells
its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The five
retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state
utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.
System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at
wholesale. The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies
heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy’s
strong support for the environment.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

Entergy Arkansas

  

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

  

Entergy Arkansas’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to
recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes
prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-
month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost
rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment
reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of
the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider
tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over-
or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2007 the
APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery
rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be
subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur
following notice and hearing.

  

Production Cost Allocation Rider

  

Entergy Arkansas has in place an APSC-approved production cost allocation
rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated
to Entergy Arkansas as a result of System Agreement proceedings.

  

Entergy Louisiana

  

Fuel Recovery

  

Entergy Louisiana’s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed
to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment
clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related
carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs
incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying
charges. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause
filings.

  

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from
the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use
of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana historically hedged approximately
one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas
used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge
quantity was reviewed on an annual basis. In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana
filed an application with the LPSC to suspend these seasonal hedging programs
and implement financial hedges with terms up to five years for a portion of
its natural gas exposure, which was approved in November 2018.

  

Entergy Louisiana’s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based
on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit
that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel
cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

  

Retail Rates - Gas

  

In accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for
implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated
with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local
governments. After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer
safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation
of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement
of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as
relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related
infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the

investment associated with these projects. The rider allows for recovery of
approximately $65 million over ten years. The rider recovery will be adjusted
on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior
quarter and is subject to the following conditions, among others: a ten-year
term; application of any earnings in excess of the upper end of the earnings
band as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider;
adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20% annually;
annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual
spending and explanation of variances exceeding 10%; and an annual true-up.
The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015. Implementation
of the infrastructure rider commenced with bills rendered on and after the
first billing cycle of April 2015.

Other

  

In March 2016 the LPSC opened two dockets to examine, on a generic basis,
issues that it identified in connection with its review of Cleco Corporation’s
acquisition by third party investors. The first docket is captioned “In re:
Investigation of double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional
utilities,” and the second is captioned “In re: Investigation of tax structure
issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities.” In April 2016 the LPSC
clarified that the concerns giving rise to the two dockets arose as a result
of its review of the structure of the Cleco-Macquarie transaction and that the
specific intent of the directives is to seek more information regarding intra-
corporate debt financing of a utility’s capital structure as well as the use
of investment tax credits to mitigate the tax obligation at the parent level
of a consolidated entity. No schedule has been set for either docket, and
limited discovery has occurred.

  

In December 2019 an LPSC commissioner issued an unopposed directive to staff
to research customer-centered options for all customer classes, as well as
other regulatory environments, and recommend a plan for how to ensure
customers are the focus. There was no opposition to the directive from other
commissioners but several remarked that the intent of the directive was not
initiated to pursue retail open access. In furtherance of the directive, the
LPSC issued a notice of the opening of a docket to conduct a rulemaking to
research and evaluate customer-centered options for all electric customer
classes as well as other regulatory environments in January 2020.

  

Entergy Mississippi

  

Fuel Recovery

  

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to
recover fuel and purchased power costs. The energy cost rate for each calendar
year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the
over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period
ended September 30. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to
annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

  

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval
from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through
the use of financial instruments. Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately
one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas
used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge
quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Formula Rate Plan

  

In August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the current
formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both
Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company’s annual
formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve
the public interest. The intent of this inquiry and review was for
informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes
to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the
existing formula rate plan proceeding. In March 2013 the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff filed its consultant’s report which noted the return on common
equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power
Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. The report
suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and
Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific
changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time.
In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study
the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied,
where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and
Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the
plans. The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate
and review Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan rider schedule and
Mississippi Power Company’s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the
merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to
propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable
to both companies. No procedural schedule has been set. In October 2014 the
Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to
discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric
utilities’ formula rate plans. The docket remains open.

  

Entergy New Orleans

  

Fuel Recovery

  

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff
designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs,
adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the
monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with
fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

  

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to
reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or
credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause,
including carrying charges.

  

To help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from
the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program
consistent with the City Council’s stated policy objectives. The program uses
financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price
of natural gas purchased to serve Entergy New Orleans gas customers. Entergy
New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter
months.

Energy Efficiency Programs

  

A 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates
to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. The rate settlement
provided an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings
targets set by the City Council and provided a mechanism for Entergy New
Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy
savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. In January 2015 the
City Council approved funding for the Energy Smart program from April 2015
through March 2017 using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of
2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being
recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. This funding methodology was
modified in November 2015 when the City Council directed Entergy New Orleans
to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior
agreement with the City Council and rough production cost equalization funds
to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel
adjustment clause. In April 2017 the City Council approved an implementation
plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2017 through December 2019. The
City Council directed that the $11.8 million balance reported for Energy Smart
funds be used to continue funding the program for Entergy New Orleans’s legacy
customers and that the Energy Smart Algiers program continue to be funded
through the Algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding
is required for the legacy customers. In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans
filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost
recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period
between when existing funds directed to Energy Smart programs are depleted and
when new rates from the 2018 combined rate case, which includes a cost
recovery mechanism for Energy Smart funding, take effect. In December 2017 the
City Council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim
funding mechanism for Energy Smart, subject to verification that no additional
funding sources exist. In June 2018 the City Council also approved a
resolution recommending that Entergy New Orleans allocate approximately $13.5
million of benefits resulting from the Tax Act to Energy Smart. See Note 2 to
the financial statements for discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s application
with the City Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the
Energy Smart program from April 2020 through December 2022.

  

Entergy Texas

  

Fuel Recovery

  

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and
purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base
rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and
September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.
The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim
surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the
PUCT. The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

  

At the PUCT’s April 2013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their
view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy. The PUCT
issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power
capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth. The rule,
as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of
purchased power agreements. Entergy Texas has not exercised the option to
recover its capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but will continue to
evaluate the benefits of utilizing the new rider to recover future capacity
costs.

  

Electric Industry Restructuring

  

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease
all activities relating to Entergy Texas’s transition to competition. The law
allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Reliability Corporation
(SERC) Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another
power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that
Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the
PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a
proceeding

248

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

exist. Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition
plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT’s
certification of Entergy Texas’s power region.

  

The law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of
a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of
reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure
improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was
previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to
Entergy Texas.

  

The law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas
to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability
to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the law
provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in
a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who
choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall “purchase
competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the
generation at retail to the customer;” and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and
price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate
that is unbundled from its cost of service. The law directs that the PUCT may
not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision,
rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.

  

The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that may be recovered through the
rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the
competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded
generation costs. The amount of customer load that may be included in the
competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW.

  

In September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution
cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to
distribution infrastructure. The distribution cost recovery factor permits
utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or
below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal
income tax and other taxes, and return on investment. The distribution cost
recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate
cases.

  

In September 2019 the PUCT initiated a rulemaking to promulgate a generation
cost recovery factor rule, implementing legislation passed in the 2019 Texas
legislative session intended to allow electric utilities to recover generation
investments between base rate proceedings. The PUCT approved the final rule in
July 2020.

  

Franchises

  

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in
approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas. These franchises
are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the
utility property. In Arkansas franchises are considered to be contracts and,
therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and
applicable statutes.

  

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service
in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated
areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana holds non-
exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City
of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish. Municipal franchise agreement
terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to
99 years.

  

Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public
convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45
counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi. Under
Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive. Entergy
Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a
statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise
is still in existence.

Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New
Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances. These
ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase
Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas utility properties.

  

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT
to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in
eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service
in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities. Entergy Texas typically
obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire. Entergy
Texas’s electric franchises expire over the period 2020-2058.

  

The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales. It has no
distribution franchises.

(a)“Owned and Leased Capability” is the dependable load carrying capability as
demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel
(assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize.

  

Summer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,591 MW over the previous
decade.

  

The Utility operating companies’ load and capacity projections are reviewed
periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity
and interconnections. These reviews consider existing and projected demand,
the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy,
Entergy’s clean energy and other public policy goals, environmental
regulations, and the age and condition of Entergy’s existing infrastructure.

  

The Utility operating companies’ long-term resource strategy (Portfolio
Transformation Strategy) calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met
through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted. Over the past
decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of
about 8,801 MW of new long-term resources and the deactivation of about 4,664
MW of legacy generation. As MISO market participants, the Utility operating
companies also participate in MISO’s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and
Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase
energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost.

RFP Procurements

  

The Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals
(RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market
to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies. The RFPs
issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet
near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as long-term requirements
through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1
to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions. The RFP

In April 2020, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Texas, issued an RFP for
combined-cycle gas turbine capacity and energy resources. The RFP was seeking
up to 1,000 MW - 1,200 MW of capacity, capacity-related benefits, energy,
other electric products, and environmental attributes, if any, from a single
generation resource located in the “Eastern Region” of Entergy Texas’s service
area. In December 2020, Entergy Texas posted notice that it has elected to
proceed with the self-build alternative, Orange County Power Station. The
self-build alternative will be conditioned on receipt of required internal and
regulatory approvals.

  

In June 2020, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Louisiana, issued an RFP
for solar photovoltaic resources. The RFP was seeking 300 MW of energy,
capacity, capacity-related benefits, other electric products, and
environmental attributes from eligible new-build solar photovoltaic generation
resources. In December 2020, Entergy Louisiana concluded evaluations of the
RFP. Three proposals have been placed on the primary selection list and two
proposals have been placed on the secondary selection list. Negotiations are
currently in progress.

  

In January 2021, Entergy Texas provided notice that it intends to issue an RFP
for solar generation resources. The RFP is seeking a minimum of 200 MW through
a combination of build-own-transfer agreements, self-build alternatives, and
power purchase agreements that can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel
diversity, and other benefits to Entergy Texas customers.

  

Other Procurements From Third Parties

  

The Utility operating companies have also made resource acquisitions outside
of the RFP process, including Entergy Mississippi’s January 2006 acquisition
of the 480 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant; Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana’s March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-

1,980 MW (summer rating), natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine Union
Power Station power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating); and Entergy
Mississippi’s October 2019 acquisition of the 810 MW, combined-cycle, natural
gas-fired Choctaw Generating Station. The Utility operating companies have
also entered into various limited- and long-term contracts in recent years as
a result of bilateral negotiations.

  

The Washington Parish Energy Center is a 361 MW natural gas-fired peaking
power plant approximately 60 miles north of New Orleans on a site Entergy
Louisiana purchased from Calpine in 2019. In May 2018, Entergy Louisiana
received LPSC approval of its certification application for this simple-cycle
power plant to be developed pursuant to an agreement between Calpine and
Entergy Louisiana. Calpine began construction on the plant in early 2019 and
Entergy Louisiana purchased the plant upon completion in November 2020.

  

The Hardin County Peaking Facility is an existing 147 MW simple-cycle gas-
fired peaking power plant in Kountze, Texas, owned by East Texas Electric
Cooperative. Entergy Texas is currently seeking regulatory certification to
move forward with the purchase of the facility. The facility has been in
operation since January 2010.

Power Through Program

  

In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to amend
its certificate of convenience and necessity to own and operate up to 75 MW of
natural gas-fired distributed generation that is to be installed at commercial
and industrial customer premises. If approved, Entergy Texas would own and
operate a fleet of generators ranging from 100 kW to 10 MW that would supply a
portion of Entergy Texas’s long-term resource needs and enhance the resiliency
of Entergy Texas’s electric grid. This fleet of generators would also be
available to customers during outages to supply backup electric service as
part of a program known as “Power Through.”

  

Interconnections

  

The Utility operating companies’ generating units are interconnected to a
transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV. These
generating units consist of steam-electric production facilities, combustion-
turbine generators, pressurized and boiling water nuclear reactors, and
inverter-based technologies operating in the MISO energy and ancillary
services market. Entergy’s Utility operating companies are MISO market
participants and are interconnected with many neighboring utilities. MISO is
an essential link in the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power
across all or parts of 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.
As a Regional Transmission Organization, MISO assures consumers of unbiased
regional grid management and open access to the transmission facilities under
MISO’s functional supervision. In addition, the Utility operating companies
are members of SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC). SERC is a nonprofit
corporation responsible for promoting and improving the reliability, adequacy,
and critical infrastructure of the bulk power supply systems in all or
portions of 16 central and southeastern states. SERC serves as a regional
entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing Bulk Electric
System reliability standards within the SERC Region.

  

Gas Property

  

As of December 31, 2020, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported
natural gas for distribution within New Orleans, Louisiana, through
approximately 2,600 miles of gas pipeline. As of December 31, 2020, the gas
properties of Entergy Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Louisiana’s financial position.

  

Title

  

The Utility operating companies’ generating stations are generally located on
properties owned in fee simple. Most of the substations and transmission and
distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way
pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises. Some substation
properties are owned in fee simple. The Utility operating companies generally
have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure
easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations.

  

Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds
issued by those companies. The Lewis Creek generating station of Entergy Texas
was acquired by merger with a subsidiary of Entergy Texas and is currently not
subject to the lien of the Entergy Texas indenture.

in 2020 and is expected to provide less than 1% of its generation in 2021.

(b)Solar power provided less than 1% of Entergy Mississippi’s and Entergy New
Orleans's generation in 2020 and is expected to provide less than 1% of each
of Entergy Mississippi’s and Entergy New Orleans's generation in 2021.

(c)Capacity and energy from System Energy’s interest in Grand Gulf is
allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas -
36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New
Orleans - 17%. Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is
selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

(d)Excludes MISO purchases.

(e)In December 2013, Entergy integrated its transmission system into the MISO
RTO. Entergy offers all of its generation into the MISO energy market on a
day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the MISO energy market to
serve the demand of its customers, with MISO making dispatch decisions. The
MISO purchases metric provided for 2020 is not projected for 2021.

  

Some of the Utility’s gas-fired plants are also capable of using fuel oil, if
necessary. Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect
fuel oil use in 2021, it is possible that various operational events including
weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil.

  

Natural Gas

  

The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term
interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation. Over 50% of
the Utility operating companies’ power plants maintain some level of long-

255

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

term firm transportation. Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases
satisfy additional gas requirements. Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility
that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating
stations.

  

Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity,
and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of
natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand is primarily tied to weather
conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources.
Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be
interrupted during periods of shortage. To the extent natural gas supplies are
disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating
companies may in some instances use alternate fuels, such as oil when
available, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and
purchased power.

  

Coal

  

Entergy Arkansas has committed to seven one- to three-year contracts that will
supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2021. These
contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed
the same year. The remaining 15% of total coal requirements will be satisfied
by contracts with a term of less than one year. Based on continued improved
Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries by rail and the high cost of
alternate sources and modes of transportation, no alternative coal consumption
is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2021. Coal will be transported to
Arkansas via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide
all of Entergy Arkansas’s rail transportation requirements for 2021.

  

Entergy Louisiana has committed to five one- to three-year contracts that will
supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2021. If needed,
additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less
than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. For the same reasons as
for Entergy Arkansas’s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at
Nelson Unit 6 during 2021. Coal will be transported to Nelson primarily via an
existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy
Louisiana’s rail transportation requirements for 2021.

  

For the year 2020, coal transportation delivery rates to Entergy Arkansas-and
Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units were adequate to meet supply needs
and obligations, and it is expected that delivery times in 2021 will continue
to be consistent. Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control a
sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement.

  

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge
capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2021. Entergy
Louisiana’s and Entergy Texas’s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit
3 are made on an annual basis.

  

Nuclear Fuel

  

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following:

  

•mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate;

•conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas;

•enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas;

•fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors;
and

•disposal of spent fuel.

  

The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated
uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling
Entergy’s Utility nuclear units. These companies own the materials and
services in this shared regulated

256

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear
generation capability of each company. Any liabilities for obligations of the
pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis. The shared regulated
uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various
stages of processing. The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium
hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average
inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool. Entergy Operations,
Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on
behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant. All
contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the
owner of a nuclear power plant.

  

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the Utility nuclear units have a
diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially
adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what
Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of
2023. Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable
prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners.
There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to
mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon
Entergy’s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its
risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate
uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium
supply at that time. In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-
fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery.

  

The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk
management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for
long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical
contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful.
Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a
diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all
qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.

  

Entergy’s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the
performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services
providers. There are fewer of these providers than for uranium. For conversion
and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by
supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply
of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel. For
fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance
of the fabricator of that plant’s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides
additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process
to assure reliability and quality.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made
arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services. The
lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the
applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of
nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes. These credit
facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued
periodically, typically for terms between three and seven years.

  

Natural Gas Purchased for Resale

  

Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its system is
interconnected with one interstate and three intrastate pipelines. Entergy New
Orleans has a “no-notice” service gas purchase contract with CenterPoint
Energy Services which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific
delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in
the contract amounts. The CenterPoint Energy Service gas supply is transported
to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with
Gulf South Pipeline Co. This service is subject to FERC-approved rates.
Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases.

  

Entergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale in 2020 under a firm
contract from Sequent Energy Management L.P. The gas is delivered through a
combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines.

  

257

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline
restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if
Entergy Louisiana’s or Entergy New Orleans’s suppliers failed to perform their
obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South Pipeline
Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system
constraints.

  

Federal Regulation of the Utility

  

State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail
rates of the Utility operating companies. The FERC regulates wholesale sales
of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including
System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of federal regulation proceedings.

  

System Agreement (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

  

Prior to each operating company’s termination of participation in the System
Agreement (Entergy Arkansas in December 2013, Entergy Mississippi in November
2015, and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas each in
August 2016), the Utility operating companies engaged in the coordinated
planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission
facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which was a rate schedule
approved by the FERC. Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating
capacity and other power resources were jointly operated by the Utility
operating companies that were participating in the System Agreement. The
System Agreement provided, among other things, that parties having generating
reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) would
receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that were less
than their allocated share of reserves (short companies). Such payments were
at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies’ costs for
intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating
expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity,
and a fair rate of return on common equity investment. Under the System
Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies were based on costs
associated with the long companies’ steam electric generating units fueled by
oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh. In
addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under
the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy were required
to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to
cover other associated costs.

  

Although the System Agreement has terminated, certain of the Utility operating
companies’ and their retail regulators are pursuing litigation involving the
System Agreement at the FERC and in federal courts. The proceedings include
challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and
other matters. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of legal
proceedings at the FERC and in federal courts involving the System Agreement.

  

Transmission and MISO Markets

  

In December 2013 the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO.
Although becoming a member of MISO did not affect the ownership by the Utility
operating companies of their transmission facilities or the responsibility for
maintaining those facilities, MISO maintains functional control over the
combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy
and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region,
including the Utility operating companies. MISO also exercises functional
control of transmission planning and congestion management and provides
schedules and pricing for the commitment and dispatch of generation that is
offered into MISO’s markets, as well as pricing for load that bids into the
markets. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary
services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer
available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO
day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market
rules. Each Utility operating company has its own transmission pricing zone
and a formula rate template (included as Attachment O to the MISO tariff) used
to

258

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

establish transmission rates within MISO. The terms and conditions of the MISO
tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of
wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are
subject to regulation by the FERC.

  

System Energy and Related Agreements

  

System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through
rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement (described below). In July 2001 a rate proceeding commenced by
System Energy at the FERC in 1995 became final, with the FERC approving a
prospective 10.94% return on equity. In 1998 the FERC approved requests by
Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their
Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. Entergy Arkansas’s and Entergy
Mississippi’s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased
effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of complaints filed with the
FERC regarding System Energy’s return on equity.

  

Unit Power Sales Agreement

  

The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related
costs from System Energy’s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to
Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%),
and Entergy New Orleans (17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make
payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full
cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered. Payments
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of
operating revenue. The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the
continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement
through rates charged to their customers.

  

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also
recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares
of Grand Gulf. Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985
and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand
Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates. In
the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to
third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price
equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas’s
cost from its retained share. Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased
power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a
portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas’s retained share of Grand Gulf to
those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to
Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power
agreement. In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from
late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect
to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana’s share of capacity and energy from
Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana retains
and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs
of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share
in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment
clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of
these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-
affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount,
subject to the LPSC’s approval. Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources
purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the
output of Entergy Arkansas’s non-retained share of Grand Gulf. Entergy
Mississippi was granted rate relief for those purchases by the MPSC through
its annual unit power cost rate mechanism.

  

Availability Agreement

  

The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in
1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy

259

of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make
available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy’s
share of Grand Gulf.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to
receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any
amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would
at least equal System Energy’s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf
(including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a
permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges.

  

The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as
Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation
percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would
govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds
available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement.

  

System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
under the Availability Agreement as security for its two outstanding series of
first mortgage bonds. In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that,
in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments
under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or
disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then
make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the
same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to
repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the
related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

  

Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement
provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if
there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the
holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment
agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the
respective obligations secured.

  

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are
subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory
approvals. Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would
require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval
with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been
made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made
pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of
capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability
Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be
submitted to the FERC for approval.

  

Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power
Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the
Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability
Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi
fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is
unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New
Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its
creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the
assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power
Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments
because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales
Agreement obligations.

  

The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual
agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or
other creditors.

Service Companies

  

Entergy Services, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Entergy
Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal,
engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies,
but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy
Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear
management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River
Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Services
and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating
companies and System Energy on an “at cost” basis, pursuant to cost allocation
methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC.

  

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

  

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a
jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies,
one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas,
and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States,
Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired
generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of
Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s 70% ownership interest in Nelson Unit 6 and 42%
ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating
plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the
extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Louisiana, as successor
in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets
that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis,
approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to
Entergy Texas.

  

Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit
purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of
River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share
of River Bend’s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the
share of the plant’s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased
power agreement. In connection with the termination of the System Agreement
effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements that were put in
place for certain legacy units at the time of the jurisdictional separation
were also terminated at that time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
additional discussion of the purchased power agreements.

  

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination

  

On October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana
(Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility. In order to
effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code
(TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a
new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability
company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the
liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger
under the TXBOC. Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated
substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of
Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under
the TXBOC. New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then merged into New Entergy
Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger. Thereupon, Old
Entergy Louisiana changed its name from “Entergy Louisiana, LLC” to “EL
Investment Company, LLC” and New Entergy Louisiana changed its name from
“Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC” to “Entergy Louisiana, LLC” (Entergy
Louisiana). With the completion of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana
holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of Old
Entergy Louisiana and Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, operation, and
decommissioning of nuclear power plants, located in the northern United States
and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to
wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities revenues are primarily
derived from sales of energy and generation capacity from these plants.
Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides operations and management
services, including decommissioning-related services, to nuclear power plants
owned by non-affiliated entities in the United States. Entergy Wholesale
Commodities also includes the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power
plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale
customers.

  

See “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business” in
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and
Analysis for further discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and sale
of each of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.

of each of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating
nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York
that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2
nuclear plants, respectively. These facilities are in various stages of the
decommissioning process. Both Big Rock Point and Indian Point 1 are under
contract to be sold with their respective plants.

  

Non-nuclear Generating Stations

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, or interests in joint
ventures that own, the following non-nuclear power plants:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

(a)“Net Owned Capacity” refers to the nameplate rating on the generating unit.

(b)The owned MW capacity is the portion of the plant capacity owned by Entergy
Wholesale Commodities. For a complete listing of Entergy’s jointly-owned
generating stations, refer to “Jointly-Owned Generating Stations” in Note 1 to
the financial statements.

(c)Indirectly owned through an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. In
December 2020, Entergy’s wholly-owned subsidiary with a direct interest in RS
Cogen, LLC entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with a
subsidiary of the other 50% equity partner to sell its 50% membership interest
in the joint venture to the equity partner. The targeted closing date for the
transaction is October 2022.

  

Independent System Operators

  

The Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New York Independent
System Operator (NYISO). The Palisades plant falls under the authority of the
MISO. The primary purpose of NYISO and MISO is to direct the operations of the
major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions;
ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets;
and plan for their respective region’s energy needs.

  

Energy and Capacity Sales

  

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is
selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale
Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells
energy in the day ahead or spot markets. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also
sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified
reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their
respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward physical power
contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity
only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While
the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these
types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of
energy, make capacity available, or both. See “Market and Credit Risk
Sensitive Instruments” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these
contracts.

  

264

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant in 2007, Entergy executed a
15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant’s output,
excluding any future uprates. Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers
Energy receives the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten
years of the agreement. Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50
basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of
the agreement. The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change
in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a
tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit,
environmental credit, “green” credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market
value. Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades nuclear power plant
permanently on May 31, 2022 and transfer to Holtec thereafter.

  

Customers

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ customers for the sale of both energy and
capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities,
electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power
generation companies. These customers include Consumers Energy, the company
from which Entergy purchased the Palisades plant, and NYISO and MISO.
Substantially all the credit exposure associated with the planned energy
output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants is with
counterparties or their guarantors that have public investment grade credit
ratings.

  

Competition

  

The NYISO market is highly competitive. Entergy Wholesale Commodities has
numerous competitors in New York including generation companies affiliated
with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-
operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power
marketers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer,
which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot
market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price
contract. Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use
most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power
customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their
own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they
buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail
providers or other market participants. Competition in the New York power
market is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and
transmission capacity in these markets. MISO does not have a centralized
clearing capacity market, but load serving entities do meet most of their
capacity needs through bilateral contracts and self-supply with a smaller
portion coming through voluntary MISO auctions. Almost all of Palisades’
current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through May 2022. Entergy
Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition
in the MISO market in the near term.

  

Seasonality

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues and operating income are subject to
fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and
contract pricing. When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are low,
generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power
plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity.
Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contracts provide for shaped pricing
over the course of the year. As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale
Commodities’ revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters
than in the second and fourth quarters.

  

Fuel Supply

  

Nuclear Fuel

  

See “Fuel Supply \- Nuclear Fuel” in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for
a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets. Entergy Nuclear Fuels
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire
nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear power plants,

265

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of
nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services. All contracts for the disposal of
spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plant
owners. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements
related to the planned permanent shutdowns of the Indian Point 3 and Palisades
plants. Fuel procurement for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment was
primarily limited to the requirements of the Palisades plant’s final refueling
in 2020.

  

Other Business Activities

  

Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize
the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.
Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants
(generating subsidiaries). As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to
assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that
were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers. ENPM’s
functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions and
generation scheduling.

  

Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale
Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel
procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training,
administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to
operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities.

  

TLG Services, a subsidiary in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment,
offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power
plant owners.

  

Entergy provides plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper
Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska. In 2010 an Entergy
subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to
Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029.

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry

  

Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974

  

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974,
the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has
broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements. The NRC has
broad authority to impose civil penalties or shut down a unit, or both,
depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend and Waterford 3, and
Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator
of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. Entergy
subsidiaries in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment are subject to the
NRC’s jurisdiction as the owners and operators of Indian Point Energy Center,
Palisades, and Big Rock Point.

  

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982

  

Spent Nuclear Fuel

  

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a
specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all
spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by
domestic nuclear power reactors. Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries
have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent
nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The
affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the
DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh
generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation
prior to that date. Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating
companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date
and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2020 of $192.0 million for the
one-time fee. Entergy accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick, Indian
Point 3, Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big
Rock Point spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous
owners. The FitzPatrick spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to Exelon as
part of the sale of the plant, completed in March 2017. The Vermont Yankee
spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to NorthStar as part of the sale of
the plant in January 2019. The Pilgrim spent fuel disposal contract was
transferred to Holtec as part of the sale of Entergy Nuclear Generation
Company in August 2019. The owners of these plants previous to Entergy have
paid or retained liability for the fees for all generation prior to the
purchase dates of those plants. The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in
the future to assure full recovery. Entergy considers all costs incurred for
the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper
components of nuclear fuel expense. Provisions to recover such costs have been
or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility
plants. Entergy’s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee
liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1.6 billion (exclusive of
amounts relating to Entergy plants that were paid or are owed by prior owners
of those plants).

  

The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be
Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE is required by law to proceed with the
licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the
license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and
commencement of receipt of spent fuel. Because the DOE has not begun accepting
spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. The DOE continues to delay
meeting its obligation. Specific steps were taken to discontinue the Yucca
Mountain project, including a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license
application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop
recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions. In August 2013
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to continue
with the Yucca Mountain license review, but only to the extent of funds
previously appropriated by Congress for that purpose and not yet used.
Although the NRC completed the safety evaluation report for the license review
in 2015, the previously appropriated funds are not sufficient to complete the
review, including required hearings. The government has taken no effective
action to date related to the recommendations of the appointed spent fuel
study commission. Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time
frame under

269

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy’s facilities for
storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be
required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy’s nuclear sites.

  

Following the defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program,
the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued
the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh
generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee. In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the
fee to zero until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or
Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan. In January 2014 the DOE
submitted the proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition
for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit. The petition for rehearing was denied.
The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014.

  

As a result of the DOE’s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in
1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel
disposal contracts, Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have
incurred and will continue to incur damages. These subsidiaries have been, and
continue to be, involved in litigation to recover the damages caused by the
DOE’s delay in performance. See Note 8 to the financial statements for
discussion of final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2018, 2019, and 2020
related to Entergy’s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries’ litigation with the
DOE. Through 2020, Entergy’s subsidiaries won and collected on judgments
against the government totaling approximately $800 million.

  

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of
nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage. Storage capability
additions using dry casks began operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in
1996, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, at Indian Point in 2008,
and at Waterford 3 in 2011. These facilities will be expanded as needed.

  

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled to recover
from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for
ANO, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively. In addition, Entergy Louisiana
and Entergy Texas are entitled to recover from customers through electric
rates the estimated decommissioning costs for the portion of River Bend
subject to retail rate regulation. The collections are deposited in trust
funds that can only be used in accordance with NRC and other applicable
regulatory requirements. Entergy periodically reviews and updates the
estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory
requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory
authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning
costs.

  

In December 2018 the APSC ordered collections in rates for decommissioning ANO
2 and found that ANO 1’s decommissioning was adequately funded without
additional collections. In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised
decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that both ANO 1 and
ANO 2 decommissioning trusts were adequately funded without further
collections, and in December 2020, the APSC ordered zero collections for ANO 1
and ANO 2 decommissioning.

  

In July 2010 the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for
Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend to address
previously identified funding shortfalls. This LPSC decision contemplated that
the level of decommissioning collections could be revisited should the NRC
grant license extensions for both Waterford 3 and River Bend. In July 2019,
following the NRC approval of license extensions for Waterford 3 and River
Bend, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking to adjust
decommissioning and depreciation rates for those plants, including one
proposed scenario that would adjust Louisiana-jurisdictional decommissioning
collections to zero for both plants (including an offsetting increase in
depreciation rates). Because of the ongoing public health emergency arising
from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic uncertainty, Entergy
Louisiana determined that the relief sought in the filing was no longer
appropriate, and in November 2020, filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the
proceeding. Following that filing, in a December 2020 order, the LPSC
dismissed the proceeding without prejudice.

In December 2010 the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for
the Texas share of River Bend to address previously identified funding
shortfalls. In December 2018 the PUCT approved a settlement that eliminated
River Bend decommissioning collections for the Texas jurisdictional share of
the plant based on a determination by Entergy Texas that the existing
decommissioning fund was adequate following license renewal.

  

In September 2016 the NRC issued a 20-year operating license renewal for Grand
Gulf. In a 2017 filing at the FERC, System Energy stated that with the renewed
operating license, Grand Gulf’s decommissioning trust was sufficiently funded,
and proposed, among other things, to cease decommissioning collections for
Grand Gulf effective October 1, 2017. The FERC accepted a settlement including
the proposed decommissioning revenue requirement by letter order in August
2018.

  

Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient for
its nuclear plants subject to retail rate regulation, although decommissioning
cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the
adequacy of the funding amounts.

  

In January 2019, Entergy sold 100% of the membership interest in Entergy
Nuclear Vermont Yankee to a subsidiary of NorthStar. As a result of the sale,
NorthStar assumed ownership of Vermont Yankee and its decommissioning and site
restoration trusts, together with complete responsibility for the facility’s
decommissioning and site restoration. See Note 9 to the financial statements
for further discussion of Vermont Yankee decommissioning costs and see
“Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business” in
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and
Analysis for further discussion of the NorthStar transaction.

  

In August 2019, Entergy sold 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear
Generation Company, LLC to a subsidiary of Holtec International. As a result
of the sale, Holtec assumed ownership of Pilgrim and its decommissioning
trust, together with complete responsibility for the facility’s
decommissioning and site restoration. See Note 14 to the financial statements
for further discussion of the sale.

  

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000 from NYPA,
NYPA retained the decommissioning trust funds and the decommissioning
liabilities with the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume each
of the decommissioning liabilities provided that it assigns the corresponding
decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries.
In August 2016, Entergy entered into a trust transfer agreement with NYPA to
transfer the decommissioning trust funds and decommissioning liabilities for
the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants to Entergy, which was completed in
January 2017. In March 2017, Entergy sold the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon, and
as part of the transaction, the FitzPatrick decommissioning trust fund, along
with the decommissioning obligation for that plant, was transferred to Exelon.
The FitzPatrick spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to Exelon as part of
the transaction. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the
FitzPatrick sale.

  

In March 2020 filings with the NRC were made reporting on decommissioning
funding for all of Entergy subsidiaries’ nuclear plants. Those reports showed
that decommissioning funding for each of the nuclear plants met the NRC’s
financial assurance requirements.

  

Additional information with respect to Entergy’s decommissioning costs and
decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 16 to the financial
statements.

  

Price-Anderson Act

  

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase and maintain
the maximum amount of nuclear liability insurance available and participate in
an industry assessment program called Secondary Financial Protection in order
to protect the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The
costs of this insurance

271

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and renewed the
Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-Anderson Act
limits the contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to a maximum
assessment of approximately $137.6 million per reactor (with 97 nuclear
industry reactors currently participating). In the case of a nuclear event in
which Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, or an Entergy
Wholesale Commodities company is liable, protection is afforded through a
combination of private insurance and the Secondary Financial Protection
program. In addition to this, insurance for property damage, costs of
replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units is
also purchased. The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear
programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial
statements.

  

NRC Reactor Oversight Process

  

The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about
plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and
provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant
performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting
from the NRC’s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the
licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the
NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: “licensee response
column,” or Column 1, “regulatory response column,” or Column 2, “degraded
cornerstone column,” or Column 3, and “multiple/repetitive degraded
cornerstone column,” or Column 4. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC
inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject
to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general,
progressively increasing levels of associated costs. The nuclear generating
plants owned and operated by Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale
Commodities businesses are currently in Column 1, except for Grand Gulf, which
is currently in Column 2.

  

In November 2020 the NRC placed Grand Gulf in Column 2 based on the incidence
of three unplanned plant scrams during the second and third quarters of 2020.
Two of the scram events related to new turbine control system components that
failed, and a third related to a feedwater valve positioner that failed, all
of which had been replaced in a refueling outage that ended in May 2020. The
NRC plans to conduct a supplemental inspection of Grand Gulf in accordance
with its inspection procedures for nuclear plants in Column 2. As a
consequence of two additional Grand Gulf scrams during the fourth quarter
2020, System Energy expects Grand Gulf to be placed into NRC Column 3 based on
plant performance indicators for the four quarters ended December 31, 2020.
This will involve an additional supplemental NRC inspection of Grand Gulf in
accordance with its inspection procedures for nuclear plants in Column 3.

  

Environmental Regulation

  

Entergy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy’s businesses are in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted
below. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future
compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated. Except to the
extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local
provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost
structure of Entergy’s businesses and is not expected to have a material
effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or
financial position.

Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments

  

The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently
or in the future may affect Entergy’s fossil-fueled generation facilities and,
to a lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other facilities.
Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated
federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal
regulatory requirements. These programs include:

  

•New source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air
pollutants, greenhouse gases, and significant modifications to existing
facilities;

•Acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx);

•Nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants, which
could include fee assessments for air pollutant emission sources under Section
185 of the Clean Air Act if attainment is not reached in a timely manner;

•Hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs;

•Interstate Air Transport;

•Operating permit programs and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act
programs;

•Regional Haze programs; and

•New and existing source standards for greenhouse gas and other air emissions.

  

New Source Review (NSR)

  

Preconstruction permits are required for new facilities and for existing
facilities that undergo a modification that results in a significant net
emissions increase and is not classified as routine repair, maintenance, or
replacement. Units that undergo certain non-routine modifications must obtain
a permit modification and may be required to install additional air pollution
control technologies. In December 2020 the EPA amended the NSR regulations to
clarify when a physical change or change in the method of operation will
constitute such a modification. Entergy has an established process for
identifying modifications requiring additional permitting approval and is
monitoring the regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and
the federal government with regard to the determination of routine repair,
maintenance, and replacement. Several years ago, however, the EPA implemented
an enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify
modifications that it does not consider routine for which the unit did not
obtain a modified permit. Various courts and the EPA have been inconsistent in
their judgments regarding modifications that are considered routine and on
other legal issues that affect this program.

  

In February 2011, Entergy received a request from the EPA for several
categories of information concerning capital and maintenance projects at the
White Bluff and Independence facilities, both located in Arkansas, in order to
determine compliance with the Clean Air Act, including NSR requirements and
air permits issued by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment,
Division of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). In August 2011, Entergy’s Nelson
facility, located in Louisiana, received a similar request for information
from the EPA. In September 2015 an additional request for similar information
was received for the White Bluff facility. Entergy responded to all requests.
None of these EPA requests for information alleged that the facilities were in
violation of law.

  

In January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters
from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association
concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting
provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-
burning units, respectively. In November 2018, following extensive
negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered
a proposed settlement resolving those claims as well as other issues facing
Entergy Arkansas’s fossil generation plants. The settlement, which formally
resolves a complaint filed by the Sierra Club and the National Parks
Conservation Association, is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Arkansas. In October 2019 the District Court
requested supplemental briefing on several issues to be resolved prior to
addressing the motion to approve the

273

settlement; that briefing was completed in May 2020. For further information
about the settlement, see “Regional Haze” discussed below.

  

National Ambient Air Quality Standards

  

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide,
particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, and requires periodic review of those
standards. When an area fails to meet an ambient standard, it is considered to
be in nonattainment and is classified as “marginal,” “moderate,” “serious,” or
“severe.” When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA
requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans
meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with
applicable standards.

  

Ozone Nonattainment

  

Entergy Texas operates two fossil-fueled generating facilities (Lewis Creek
and Montgomery County Power Station) in a geographic area that is not in
attainment with the applicable NAAQS for ozone. The ozone nonattainment area
that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. Both Lewis
Creek and the Montgomery County Power Station hold all necessary permits for
construction and operation and comply with applicable air quality program
regulations. Measures enacted to return the area to ozone attainment could
make these program regulations more stringent. Entergy will continue to work
with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing
attainment and nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS.

  

Potential SO2 Nonattainment

  

The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO2 1-hour national
ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion. In Entergy’s utility
service territory, only St. Bernard Parish and Evangeline Parish in Louisiana
are designated as nonattainment. In August 2017 the EPA issued a letter
indicating that East Baton Rouge and St. Charles parishes would be designated
by December 31, 2020, as monitors were installed to determine compliance. In
December 2020 the EPA designated East Baton Rouge, St. Charles, St. James, and
West Baton Rouge parishes in Louisiana as attainment/unclassifiable, and, in
Texas, Jefferson County as attainment/unclassifiable and Orange County as
unclassifiable. Challenges to these final designations must be filed within 60
days of publication in the Federal Register. Entergy continues to monitor this
situation.

  

Hazardous Air Pollutants

  

The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in
December 2011, which had a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year
extension, of April 2016. The required controls have been installed and are
operational at all affected Entergy units. In May 2020 the EPA finalized a
rule that finds that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate
hazardous air pollutants from electric steam generating units under the
provisions of section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act. This is a reversal of the
EPA’s previous finding requiring such regulation. The final appropriate and
necessary finding does not revise the underlying MATS rule. Several lawsuits
have been filed challenging the appropriate and necessary finding. Entergy
will continue to monitor this situation.

  

Cross-State Air Pollution

  

In March 2005 the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which
was intended to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from electric generation plants
in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states. The rule
required a combination of capital investment to install pollution control
equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission
allowances. Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of
controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance
procurement strategy.

  

274

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

Based on several court challenges, CAIR and its subsequent versions, now known
as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), have been remanded to and
modified by the EPA on multiple occasions. In September 2016 the EPA finalized
the CSAPR Update Rule to address interstate transport for the 2008 ozone
NAAQS. Starting in 2017 the final rule requires reductions in summer nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emissions. Several states, including Arkansas and Texas, filed a
challenge to the Update Rule. In September 2019 the D.C. Circuit upheld the
EPA’s underlying approach to the Update Rule, but determined that it was
inconsistent with the Clean Air Act because it failed to include deadlines
consistent with downwind states’ deadlines for attainment. The court remanded
the rule to the EPA for further consideration, but did not vacate so the rule
remains in effect pending the EPA’s further review. In October 2020 the EPA
issued its proposal intended to address the D.C. Circuit’s remand. The draft
rule proposes to finalize interstate transport obligations for 21 states. For
nine states, including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, the EPA proposes that
additional emission reductions are not necessary. For 12 states, however,
including Louisiana, the EPA proposes additional emission reductions through
proposed reductions in the number of NOx emission allowances allocated to each
state. Entergy, through its various trade associations, filed comments on the
proposal and will continue to monitor the rulemaking and its potential impact
on its facilities in Louisiana. If the October 2020 proposal is finalized,
ozone season NOx emissions may become more expensive in Louisiana.

  

Regional Haze

  

In June 2005 the EPA issued its final Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR)
regulations that potentially could result in a requirement to install SO2 and
NOx pollution control technology as Best Available Retrofit Control Technology
(BART) to continue operating certain of Entergy’s fossil generation units. The
rule leaves certain CAVR determinations to the states.

  

In Arkansas, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a state implementation plan (SIP) for
Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the CAVR. In April 2012
the EPA finalized a decision addressing the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, in
which it disapproved a large portion of the Arkansas plan, including the
emission limits for NOx and SO2 at White Bluff. In April 2015 the EPA
published a proposed federal implementation plan (FIP) for Arkansas, taking
comment on requiring installation of scrubbers and low NOx burners to continue
operating both units at the White Bluff plant and both units at the
Independence plant and NOx controls to continue operating the Lake Catherine
plant. Entergy filed comments by the deadline in August 2015. Among other
comments, including opposition to the EPA’s proposed controls on the
Independence units, Entergy proposed to meet more stringent SO2 and NOx limits
at both White Bluff and Independence within three years of the effective date
of the final FIP and to cease the use of coal at the White Bluff units at a
later date.

  

In September 2016 the EPA published the final Arkansas Regional Haze FIP. In
most respects, the EPA finalized its original proposal but shortened the time
for compliance for installation of the NOx controls. The FIP required an
emission limitation consistent with SO2 scrubbers at both White Bluff and
Independence by October 2021 and NOx controls by April 2018. The EPA declined
to adopt Entergy’s proposals related to ceasing coal use as an alternative to
SO2 scrubbers for White Bluff SO2 BART. In November 2016, Entergy and other
interested parties, including the State of Arkansas, filed petitions for
administrative reconsideration and stay at the EPA as well as petitions for
judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The
Eighth Circuit granted the stay pending settlement discussions and pending the
State’s development of a SIP that, if approved by the EPA, would replace the
FIP. The state had proposed its replacement SIP in two parts: Part I considers
NOx requirements, and Part II considers SO2 requirements. The EPA approved the
Part I NOx SIP in January 2018. The Part I SIP requires that Entergy address
NOx impacts on visibility via compliance with the Cross-State Air Pollution
Rule ozone-season emission trading program. Arkansas has finalized a Part II
SIP which has been approved by the EPA but is currently pending a state court
appeal. That appeal has been stayed pending the outcome of a federal court
case, which may resolve many of the issues on appeal. The final Part II SIP
requires that Entergy achieve SO2 emission reductions via the use of low-
sulfur coal at both White Bluff and Independence within three years. The

275

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

Part II SIP also requires that Entergy cease to use coal at White Bluff by
December 31, 2028 and notes the current planning assumption that Entergy’s
Independence units will cease to use coal by December 31, 2030.

  

In January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters
from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association
concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting
provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-
burning units, respectively. In November 2018, following extensive
negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered
a proposed settlement resolving those claims and reducing the risk that
Entergy Arkansas, as operator of Independence and White Bluff, might be
compelled under the Clean Air Act’s regional haze program to install costly
emissions control technologies. Consistent with the terms of the settlement
and in many cases also the Part II SIP, Entergy Arkansas, along with co-
owners, will begin using only low-sulfur coal at Independence and White Bluff
by mid-2021; cease to use coal at White Bluff and Independence by the end of
2028 and 2030, respectively; cease operation of the remaining gas unit at Lake
Catherine by the end of 2027; reserve the option to develop new generating
sources at each plant site; and commit to install or propose to regulators at
least 800 MWs of renewable generation by the end of 2027, with at least half
installed or proposed by the end of 2022 (which includes two existing Entergy
Arkansas projects) and with all qualifying co-owner projects counting toward
satisfaction of the obligation. Under the settlement, the Sierra Club and the
National Parks Conservation Association also waive certain potential existing
claims under federal and state environmental law with respect to specified
generating plants. The settlement, which formally resolves a complaint filed
by the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, is subject
to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
The EPA, which is allowed to comment on such a settlement agreement, has
stated that it has no objections to the settlement. In November 2020 the court
denied motions by the Arkansas Attorney General and the Arkansas Affordable
Energy Coalition to intervene and to stay the proceedings. The proposed
intervenors did not appeal the ruling. Still pending before the court is a
motion by the plaintiffs to approve the settlement, in support of which
Entergy made a filing. The Arkansas Attorney General also filed an application
before the APSC in December 2018 seeking an investigation into the effects of
the settlement. The Arkansas Affordable Energy Coalition filed to support the
Arkansas Attorney General’s application, and Entergy Arkansas filed a motion
to dismiss it. The application remains pending before the APSC. In October
2019 the District Court requested supplemental briefing on several issues
prior to addressing the motion to approve the settlement; that briefing
concluded in May 2020.

  

In Louisiana, Entergy has worked with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the EPA to revise the Louisiana SIP for
regional haze, which had been disapproved in part in 2012. The LDEQ submitted
a revised SIP in February 2017. In May 2017 the EPA proposed to approve a
majority of the revisions. In September 2017 the EPA issued a proposed SIP
approval for the Nelson plant, requiring an emission limitation consistent
with the use of low-sulfur coal, with a compliance date of January 22, 2021.
The EPA issued final approval in December 2017. The EPA approval was appealed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In October 2019 the Fifth
Circuit affirmed the EPA’s SIP approval. A petition for rehearing filed by
plaintiffs was denied by the Fifth Circuit. Plaintiffs did not petition for
further review by the Supreme Court.

  

The second planning period (2018-2028) for the regional haze program requires
states to examine sources for impacts on visibility and to prepare SIPs by
2021. Entergy received information collection requests from Arkansas and
Louisiana requesting an evaluation of technical and economic feasibility of
various NOx and SO2 control technologies for Independence, Nelson 6, and
Ninemile. Responses to the information requests have been submitted to the
respective state agencies.

  

New and Existing Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions

  

In July 2019 the EPA released the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), which
applies only to existing coal-fired electric generating units. The ACE
determines that heat rate improvements are the best system of emission
reductions and lists six candidate technologies for consideration by states at
each coal unit. The rule and associated rulemakings by the EPA replace the
Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which established

276

national emissions performance rates for existing fossil-fuel fired steam
electric generating units and combustion turbines. The ACE rule provides
states discretion in determining how the best system for emission reductions
applies to individual units, including through the consideration of technical
feasibility and the remaining useful life of the facility. The ADEQ and the
LDEQ have issued information collection requests to Entergy facilities to help
the states collect the information needed to determine the best system of
emission reductions for each facility. Entergy responded to the requests and
will continue to monitor litigation challenging the rule. In January 2021 the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated ACE. The court held that
ACE relied on an incorrect interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the
statute expressly forecloses emission reduction approaches, such as emissions
trading and generating shifting, that cannot be applied at and to the
individual source. The court remanded ACE to the EPA for further consideration
and also vacated the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. The vacatur will not be
effective until the court issues its mandate which is being held until after
disposition of any petitions for rehearing. Entergy is currently reviewing the
court’s opinion.

  

In 2018 the EPA proposed a revision to the new source performance standard on
greenhouse gas emissions that primarily impacts new coal units and, therefore,
should not impact Entergy. In January 2021 the EPA finalized a pollutant-
specific contribution finding for greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified,
and reconstructed electric generating units. The rule establishes a three
percent threshold for determining when a pollutant significantly contributes
to air pollution and reaffirms the EPA’s position that the Clean Air Act
Section 111(b) requires the EPA to make pollutant-specific significant
contribution findings before promulgation of a new source performance
standard. The EPA did not, however, finalize the new source performance
standard on greenhouse gas emissions and intends to address the 2018 proposal
in a future action.

  

Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments

  

In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of
legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning air emissions, as well as
other media, that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local
level. Because of the nature of Entergy’s business, the imposition of any of
these initiatives could affect Entergy’s operations. Entergy continues to
monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential
operational and cost implications. These initiatives include:

  

•designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not
in attainment with national ambient air quality standards;

•introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA
proposing further limits on NOx, SO2, mercury, and carbon dioxide and other
air emissions. New legislation or regulations applicable to stationary sources
could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct
requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission
sources, or other or combined regulatory programs;

•efforts in Congress or at the EPA to establish a federal carbon dioxide
emission tax, control structure, or unit performance standards;

•revisions to the estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon and its use for
regulatory impact analysis of federal laws and regulations;

•implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several states in
the northeastern United States and similar actions in other regions of the
United States;

•efforts on the local, state, and federal level to codify renewable portfolio
standards, clean energy standards, or a similar mechanism requiring utilities
to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined
renewable energy sources or energy sources with lower emissions;

•efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent
limitations for Entergy’s industry sector, stormwater runoff control
regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements;

•efforts to restrict the previously-approved continued use of oil-filled
equipment containing certain levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs);

•efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of
environmental, social, and governance risk;

277

•the listing of additional species as threatened or endangered, the protection
of critical habitat for these species, and developments in the legal
protection of eagles and migratory birds;

•the regulation of the management, disposal, and beneficial reuse of coal
combustion residuals; and

•the regulation of the management and disposal and recycling of equipment
associated with renewable and clean energy sources such as used solar panels,
wind turbine blades, hydrogen usage, or battery storage.

  

Entergy continues to support national legislation that would increase planning
certainty for electric utilities while addressing carbon dioxide emissions in
an economy-wide, responsible, and flexible manner. By virtue of its
proportionally large investment in low-emitting generation technologies,
Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission “intensity,” or rate of
carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. In
anticipation of the imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the
electric industry, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure
to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide
emissions. These voluntary actions included a formal program to stabilize
owned power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and
Entergy succeeded in reducing emissions below 2000 levels. In 2006, Entergy
started including emissions from controllable power purchases in addition to
its ownership share of generation and established a second formal voluntary
program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from
controllable power purchases, cumulatively over the period, at 20% below 2000
levels through 2010. In 2011, Entergy extended this commitment through 2020.
In 2020, Entergy succeeded in achieving its initial climate commitment to
reduce carbon dioxide cumulative emissions by 20% from 2000 levels. Total
carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power
plants and controllable power purchases in the United States were
approximately 39.1 million tons in 2020 and 40.7 million tons in 2019. Since
its original commitment in 2001, Entergy’s cumulative emissions are
approximately 7.6% below its 2020 goal.

  

Entergy voluntarily conducted a climate scenario analysis and published a
comprehensive report in March 2019. The report follows the framework and
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures, describing
climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and
targets. Scenario analyses resulted in Entergy developing and publishing a new
goal of reducing the Utility’s emission rate by 50 percent from 2000 levels by
2030. In September 2020, Entergy committed to achieving net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050, while continuing its commitment to grid reliability and
affordability for customers. In December 2020, Entergy published a report
regarding this long-term commitment that describes its approach and technology
point-of-view. Technology research and development, innovation, and
advancement are critical to Entergy’s ability to meet this climate commitment.

  

Entergy participates in the M.J. Bradley & Associates’ Annual Benchmarking Air
Emissions Report, an annual analysis of the 100 largest U.S. electric power
producers. The report is available on the M.J. Bradley website. Entergy’s
annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory is also third-party verified, and
that certification is made available on the American Carbon Registry website.
Entergy participates annually in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and in
2020 was listed on the North American Index. Entergy has been listed on the
World or North American Index, or both, for nineteen consecutive years.
Entergy also participated in the 2020 CDP and CDP Water evaluations, receiving
a ‘B’ for both responses.

  

Clean Water Act

  

The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the
Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit program, section 402, and the basic
structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to
waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act requires virtually all
discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted.
Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake
structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality
certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and
approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the
United States, including jurisdictional wetlands.

Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines

  

The 2015 Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) rule required,
among other things, that there be no discharge of bottom ash transport water.
In October 2020 the EPA issued its final rule revision on bottom ash transport
water allowing the discharge of up to 10% system volume for certain purge
waters, including storm events and non-routine operations. The final rule
requires compliance as soon as possible beginning October 31, 2021, but no
later than December 31, 2025. Several challenges to the final rule have been
filed. Additionally, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previously vacated and
remanded the provisions of the rule related to legacy wastewater and leachate,
which the EPA plans to address in a separate rulemaking. Despite the final
rule and pending challenges, Entergy is implementing projects at its White
Bluff and Independence plants to convert to zero-discharge systems to comply
with the ELG rule and the coal combustion residuals restrictions on
impoundments. Additionally, the Nelson Unit 6 facility is implementing
operational and maintenance measures to minimize the potential for discharge
of bottom ash transport water from the existing bottom ash handling system at
the site, and is reviewing the effectiveness of these changes for compliance
with the requirements of the October 2020 final rule.

  

Federal Jurisdiction of Waters of the United States

  

In February 2019 the EPA published its proposed revised definition of Waters
of the United States, which proposes to narrow the scope of Clean Water Act
jurisdiction, as compared to a 2015 definition which had been stayed by
several federal courts. The final rule was released in January 2020 and
effective in June 2020. In October 2019 the EPA repealed the 2015 rule and re-
codified the pre-existing regulations. That rule was effective late December
2019. Numerous challenges have been filed against both rules.

  

Groundwater at Certain Nuclear Sites

  

The NRC requires nuclear power plants to monitor and report regularly the
presence of radioactive material in the environment. Entergy joined other
nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a
voluntary groundwater monitoring and protection program. This initiative began
after detection of very low levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium,
in groundwater at several plants in the United States. Tritium is a
radioactive form of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is also a byproduct of
nuclear plant operations. In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have
been found in site groundwater at nuclear plants.

  

As part of the groundwater monitoring and protection program, Entergy has: (1)
performed reviews of plant groundwater characteristics (hydrology) and
historical records of past events on site that may have potentially impacted
groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on how to handle events that
could impact groundwater; and (3) installed groundwater monitoring wells and
began periodic sampling. The program also includes protocols for notifying
local officials if contamination is found. To date, radionuclides such as
tritium have been detected at Arkansas Nuclear One, Indian Point, Palisades,
Grand Gulf, and River Bend. Each of these sites has installed groundwater
monitoring wells and implemented a program for testing groundwater at the
sites for the presence of tritium and other radionuclides. Based on current
information, the concentrations and locations of radionuclides detected at
these plants pose no threat to public health or safety, but each site
continues to evaluate the results from its groundwater monitoring program.

  

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

  

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to
collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at
which hazardous substances may be or have been released. Certain private
parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs. Parties that
transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal
of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA. CERCLA has been
interpreted to impose strict, joint, and several liability on responsible
parties. Many states have adopted programs similar to CERCLA. Entergy
subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have
sent waste materials to various

279

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

disposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy
facilities including nuclear facilities that have been or will be sold to
decommissioning companies. In addition, environmental laws now regulate
certain of Entergy’s operating procedures and maintenance practices that
historically were not subject to regulation. Some disposal sites used by
Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA
or similar state programs, resulting in site clean-up activities. Entergy
subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their
respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed
experience with clean-up costs. The affected Entergy subsidiaries have
established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and
restoration activities. Details of potentially material CERCLA and similar
state program liabilities are discussed in the “Other Environmental Matters”
section below.

  

Coal Combustion Residuals

  

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals
(CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs
destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface
impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program
of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C; or (2) regulating
CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-
hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA. Under both options, CCRs that are
beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous
waste regulation. In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the
material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-
hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D.

  

The final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified
storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal
considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria. Entergy believes that on-site
disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for
CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse. As of December 31, 2020,
Entergy has recorded asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of
$20.1 million.

  

In December 2016 the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act
(WIIN Act) was signed into law, which authorizes states to regulate coal ash
rather than leaving primary enforcement to citizen suit actions. States may
submit to the EPA proposals for a permit program.

  

Pursuant to the EPA Rule, Entergy operates groundwater monitoring systems
surrounding its coal combustion residual landfills located at White Bluff,
Independence, and Nelson. Monitoring to date has detected concentrations of
certain listed constituents in the area, but has not indicated that these
constituents originated at the active landfill cells. Reporting has occurred
as required, and detection monitoring will continue as the rule requires. In
late-2017, Entergy determined that certain in-ground wastewater treatment
system recycle ponds at its White Bluff and Independence facilities require
management under the new EPA regulations. Consequently, in order to move away
from using the recycle ponds, White Bluff and Independence each have installed
a new permanent bottom ash handling system that does not fall under the CCR
rule. As of November 2020, both sites are operating the new system and no
longer are sending waste to the recycle ponds. Each site has commenced closure
of one of its two recycle ponds, with the remaining pond being held in reserve
during initial operation of the new bottom ash handling system. Closure of the
remaining recycle pond at each site will commence as soon as possible, but no
later than April 11, 2021, which is the deadline under the finalized CCR rule
to commence closure of any unlined recycle ponds. Any potential requirements
for corrective action or operational changes under the new CCR rule continue
to be assessed. Notably, ongoing litigation has resulted in the EPA’s
continuing review of the rule. Consequently, the nature and cost of additional
corrective action requirements may depend, in part, on the outcome of the
EPA’s review.

Other Environmental Matters

  

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas

  

Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
currently is involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the
Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. A
manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from
approximately 1916 to 1931. Coal tar, a by-product of the distillation process
employed at MGPs, apparently was routed to a portion of the property for
disposal. The same area also has been used as a landfill. In 1999, Entergy
Gulf States, Inc. signed a second administrative consent order with the EPA to
perform a removal action at the site. Removal actions addressed contaminated
source material, soil, and sediment and included capping certain soil on and
off-site. In 2002 approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and debris
were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service center. In 2003
a cap was constructed over the remedial area to prevent the migration of
contamination to the surface. In August 2005 an administrative order was
issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year groundwater study be conducted at
this site. The groundwater monitoring study commenced in January 2006. The EPA
released the second Five Year Review in 2015. In that review, the EPA
indicated that the remediation technique was insufficient and that Entergy
would need to utilize other remediation technologies on the site. In July
2015, Entergy submitted a Focused Feasibility Study to the EPA outlining the
potential remedies and suggesting installation of the new remedial method, a
waterloo barrier. The estimated cost for this remedy is approximately $2
million, to be allocated between Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas. In early
2017 the EPA indicated that the waterloo barrier may not be necessary and
requested revisions to the Focused Feasibility Study. The EPA released the
third Five Year Review in late-2019 confirming that a new remedial method is
not necessary but requiring continuation of the current groundwater
monitoring. The site’s remedy includes monitored natural attenuation of
groundwater, and institutional controls to restrict groundwater and land use.
The EPA has determined that no additional actions are needed for the remedy to
be protective over the long-term, and the remedy is protective of human health
and the environment.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas

  

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas that the
TCEQ believes those entities are potentially responsible parties (PRPs)
concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service Company
(SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas. The facility operated as a transformer
repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until 2003. Both soil and
groundwater contamination existed at the site. Entergy subsidiaries sent
transformers to this facility. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and
Entergy Texas responded to an information request from the TCEQ. Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Texas joined a group of PRPs responding to site
conditions in cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation
models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and
investigating contribution actions against other PRPs. Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the remediation of contaminated
soil and groundwater at the site in a measure proportionate to those
companies’ involvement at the site. Current estimates, although variable
depending on ultimate remediation design and performance, indicate that
Entergy’s total share of remediation costs likely will be approximately $1.5
million to $2 million. Groundwater monitoring wells at the site were plugged
and abandoned in December 2019 following receipt of a certificate of
completion issued by the TCEQ. Site decommissioning activities are complete
and final disposition of the property will be determined at a later time.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas

  

The EPA notified Entergy that the EPA believes Entergy is a PRP concerning PCB
contamination at the F.J. Doyle Salvage facility in Leonard, Texas. The
facility operated as a scrap salvage business during the 1970s to the 1990s.
In May 2018 the EPA investigated the site surface and sub-surface soils and,
in November 2018 the EPA conducted a removal action, including disposal of PCB
contaminated soils. Entergy responded to the EPA’s information requests in May
and July 2019. In November 2020 the EPA sent Entergy and other PRPs a demand

281

letter seeking reimbursement for response costs totaling $4 million expended
at the site. The demand letter is being evaluated and liability and PRP
allocation of response costs are yet to be determined.

  

Entergy Texas

  

In December 2016 a transformer inside the Hartburg, Texas Substation had an
internal fault resulting in a release of approximately 15,000 gallons of non-
PCB mineral oil. Cleanup ensued immediately; however, rain caused much of the
oil to spread across the substation yard and into a nearby wetland. The TCEQ
and the National Response Center were immediately notified, and the TCEQ
responded to the site approximately two hours after the cleanup was initiated.
The remediation liability is estimated at $2.2 million; however, this number
could fluctuate depending on the remediation extent and wetland mitigation
requirements. In July 2017, Entergy entered into the Voluntary Cleanup Program
with the TCEQ. In November 2017, additional soil sampling was completed in the
wetland area and, in February 2018, a site summary report of findings was
submitted to the TCEQ. The TCEQ responded in June 2018 and requested an
ecological exclusion criteria checklist/Tier II screening-level ecological
risk assessment, and additional site assessment, additional soil samples,
groundwater samples, and some additional diagrams and maps. In October 2018,
Entergy submitted the requested information to the TCEQ. In January 2019 the
TCEQ responded with another request for information. In March 2019, Entergy
submitted the requested information to the TCEQ. In August 2019 the TCEQ
responded with a request for additional information including an Affected
Property Assessment Report (APAR) and water well survey. The TCEQ has agreed
that the necessity of the water well survey is dependent on the results of the
groundwater resampling that will occur. Groundwater sampling was completed in
December 2019 and results were submitted to the TCEQ for review. Based on the
groundwater sampling results, the TCEQ confirmed in February 2020 that a water
well survey is not necessary and requested the APAR and an Ecological Risk
Assessment by August 2020. Due to COVID-19 delays, the TCEQ extended the APAR
and Ecological Risk Assessment submittal dates to December 2020, which Entergy
timely met.

  

Litigation

  

Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or
filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to
be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large
verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury,
property damage, and business tort cases. The litigation environment in these
states poses a significant business risk to Entergy.

Governance and Oversight

  

Ensuring that workplace processes support the desired culture and strategy
begins with the Board of Directors and the Office of the Chief Executive. The
Personnel Committee establishes priorities and reviews performance on a range
of topics. It oversees Entergy’s incentive plan design and administers its
executive compensation plans to incentivize the behaviors and outcomes that
support achievement of Entergy’s corporate objectives. Annually, it reviews
executive performance, development and succession plans to align a high
performing executive team with Entergy’s priorities. The Personnel Committee
also oversees Entergy’s performance through regular briefings on a wide
variety of human resources topics including Entergy’s safety culture and
performance; organizational health; and diversity, inclusion, and belonging
initiatives and performance.

  

Other committees of the Board oversee other key aspects of Entergy’s culture.
For example, the Audit Committee reviews reports on ethics and compliance
training and performance, as well as regular reports on calls made to
Entergy’s ethics line and related investigations. To maximize the sharing of
information and facilitate the participation of all Board members in these
discussions, the Board schedules its regular committee meetings in a manner
such that all directors can attend.

  

The Office of the Chief Executive, which includes the Senior Vice President
and Chief Human Resources Officer, ensures annual business plans are designed
to support Entergy’s talent objectives, reviews workforce-related metrics, and
regularly discusses the development, succession planning, and performance of
their direct reports and other company officers.

  

Safety

  

Entergy’s safety objective is: Everyone Safe. All Day. Every Day. While the
COVID-19 pandemic and historical hurricane season presented significant
challenges, Entergy’s safety strategy and commitment to excellence showed
results in 2020. Entergy employees achieved a total recordable incident rate
of 0.40 in 2020 compared to 0.56 in 2019 and 0.48 in 2018. The recordable
incident rate equals the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time
equivalents. Recordable incidents include fatalities, lost-time accidents,
restricted-duty accidents, and medical attentions and is not inclusive of
potential work-related COVID-19 cases. This marked improvement in total
recordable incident rate placed Entergy in top-decile in safety performance
when benchmarked amongst peers within the Edison Electric Institute.

  

Organizational Health, including Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging

  

Entergy believes that organizational health fosters an engaged and productive
culture that positions Entergy to deliver sustainable value to its
stakeholders. Entergy measures its progress through an organizational health
survey coordinated by an external third party. Since initially administering
the survey in 2014, Entergy improved from an initial score of 49 (fourth
quartile) to a score in 2020 of 72 (near top quartile). In addition to
significantly improved scores, initial employee participation of 66 percent in
2014 rose to and remains at 90 percent in 2018-2020.

  

Entergy believes that a culture focused on diversity, inclusion, and belonging
drives foundational engagement. Entergy is committed to developing and
retaining a workforce that reflects the rich diversity of the communities it
serves. In 2019, Entergy embarked on a three-year phased approach to enhance
inclusion for individuals and teams. Among other actions, the primary focus of
its 2020 actions was taking a stand against social injustice, reinforcing
expectations, training and leading by example, starting at the top of the
organization and cascading through management ranks.

Talent Management

  

Entergy’s focus on talent management is organized in three areas: developing
and attracting a diverse pool of talent, equipping its leaders to develop the
organization, and building premier utility capability through employee
performance management and succession programs. Entergy believes that
developing a diverse pool of local talent equipped with the skills needed,
today and in the future, and reflecting the communities Entergy serves will
give it a long-term competitive advantage. The focus of Entergy’s leadership
development programs is to equip managers with the skills needed to
effectively develop their teams and improve the leader-employee relationship.
Entergy’s talent development infrastructure, which includes a combination of
business function-specific and enterprise-wide learning and development
programs, is designed to ensure Entergy has qualified staff with the skills,
experiences, and behaviors needed to perform today and prepare for the future.
Entergy strives to achieve its strategic priorities by aligning and enhancing
team and individual performance with business objectives, effectively
deploying talent through succession planning, and managing workforce
transitions.

RISK FACTORS

  

See “RISK FACTOR SUMMARY” in Part I Item 1 for a summary of Entergy’s and the
Registrant Subsidiaries’ risk factors.

  

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other
information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to
those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either
currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could
adversely affect Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, and
liquidity. See “FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.”

  

Utility Regulatory Risks

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken on
Entergy’s and its Utility operating companies’ business, results of
operations, and financial condition are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted.

  

In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced
in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread throughout most countries in
the world, including the United States. Public health officials in the United
States have both recommended and mandated wearing of masks, precautions to
mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in
heavily-populated areas, mandated closure or limitations on the functions of
non-essential business, and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures,
including throughout Entergy’s service areas. While some of these mitigation
measures have been lifted, it is unclear how long certain forms of mitigation
measures will remain in place, whether they will be reinstated in the future,
and how they will ultimately impact the general economy, Entergy’s customers,
and its operations.

  

Entergy and its Utility operating companies have experienced a decline in
commercial and industrial sales and an increase in arrearages and bad debt
expense due to non-payment by customers, and expect such reduced levels of
sales and increased arrearages and bad debt expense to continue, the extent
and duration of which management cannot predict. The Utility operating
companies temporarily suspended disconnecting customers for non-payment of
bills, and the suspension remains in place at Entergy Arkansas, has been re-
instituted at Entergy New Orleans, and could be re-instituted at the other
Utility operating companies should their regulators mandate. While they are
working with regulators to ensure ultimate recovery for those and other
COVID-19 related costs, the amount, method, and timing of such recovery is
unknown. Entergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries also could experience, and in
some cases have experienced, among other challenges, supply chain, vendor, and
contractor disruptions; delays in completion of capital or other construction
projects, maintenance, and other operations activities, including prolonged or
delayed outages; delays in regulatory proceedings; workforce availability,
health or safety issues; increased storm recovery costs; increased
cybersecurity risks as a result of many employees telecommuting; increased
late or uncollectible customer payments; volatility in the credit or capital
markets (and any related increased cost of capital or any inability to access
the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities); or other adverse
impacts on their ability to execute on business strategies and initiatives.

  

A sustained or further economic decline could adversely impact Entergy’s and
the Utility operating companies’ liquidity and cash flows, including through
declining sales, reduced revenues, delays in receipts of customer payments, or
increased bad debt expense. The Utility operating companies also may
experience regulatory outcomes that require them to postpone planned
investment and otherwise reduce costs due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on their customers. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues
to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or
adversely impacts Entergy’s credit metrics or ratings, such developments could
adversely affect its ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue
to meet its

286

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

liquidity needs, or cause a decrease in the value of its defined benefit
pension trust funds, as well as its nuclear decommissioning trust funds, all
of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

  

Entergy cannot predict the extent or duration of the outbreak, the impact of
new variants of COVID-19, the timing, availability, distribution or
effectiveness of a vaccine, anti-viral or other treatments for COVID-19,
governmental responsive measures, or the extent of the effects or ultimate
impacts on the global, national or local economy, the capital markets, or its
customers, suppliers, operations, financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows.

  

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the
Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through
regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal,
potentially resulting in delays in effecting rate changes, lengthy litigation
and uncertainty as to ultimate results.

  

The Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of
return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and
procedures. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy
charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs,
allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These
rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations,
and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and
System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are
subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment
upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders.

  

In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence
of costs in the Utility operating companies’ and System Energy’s base rates
and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the
companies’ operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures
(including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed
rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously
incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in
rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found
not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in
compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate
recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other
matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates.
Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally
have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may
not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate
proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to
experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the
Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate
effective period and the Utility operating companies may, therefore, earn less
than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal,
potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case
proceedings.

  

The Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and,
as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity
focused on issues including the operation of their assets and infrastructure
or the quality of their service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature
could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service
commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less
likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could
potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes,
as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent
legislative or regulatory requirements.

  

The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base
rate case proceedings. Between base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has
available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with
certain incremental costs. These riders include a distribution cost recovery
factor rider mechanism for the recovery of distribution-related capital
investment and certain non-fuel MISO charges, a transmission cost recovery
factor rider mechanism for the recovery of transmission-related capital
investments, a generation cost recovery rider mechanism for the recovery of
generation-related capital investments, and a fixed fuel factor mechanism for
the recovery of MISO fuel and energy-related costs. Entergy Texas also is
required to make a filing every three years,

287

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor
revenues. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether
eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and
reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related
contracts for the reconciliation period. Entergy Texas also is required to
file full base rate case proceedings every four years and within eighteen
months of utilizing its generation cost recovery rider for investments above
$200 million.

  

Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to
adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward
test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy
Mississippi). In response to Entergy Arkansas’s application for a general
change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff
proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period
and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expires in 2021.
Entergy Arkansas has requested APSC approval of the extension of the formula
rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. If Entergy
Arkansas’s formula rate plan were terminated or not extended beyond the
initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change
in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula
rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan is
terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or
seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy
Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs
through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively.

  

Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a
formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate
plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business
combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely
followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection
with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February
2013. The formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year
2019; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease
to the allowed return on equity and the addition of a transmission cost
recovery mechanism. The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from
the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment
projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and
purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC and as noted, for certain
transmission investment, among other items. MISO fuel and energy-related costs
are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause. Entergy
Louisiana has a pending request to extend its formula rate plan with certain
modifications, including implementation of a distribution investment recovery
mechanism and use of end of period rate base. In the event that the electric
formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, Entergy Louisiana would revert
to the more traditional rate case environment.

  

Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended
with the 2011 test year. Based on a settlement agreement approved by the City
Council, with limited exceptions, the base rates of Entergy New Orleans were
frozen until rates were implemented in connection with the base rate case
filed by Entergy New Orleans in 2018. In November 2019 the City Council issued
a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective
retroactive to August 2019. The resolution allows Entergy New Orleans to
implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as
adjusted for forward-looking known and measurable changes. In November 2020
the City Council issued a resolution approving a settlement of the 2018 rate
case. As part of this settlement, Entergy New Orleans agreed to postpone the
filing of its first test year formula rate plan to 2021 and, in return, to be
provided an additional test year for the three-year cycle. See Note 2 to the
financial statements for further discussion.

  

The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed
to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the
participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales
Agreement, which has monthly billings that reflect the current operating costs
of, and investment in, Grand Gulf. Retail regulators and other parties may
seek to initiate proceedings at FERC to investigate the prudence of costs
included in the rates charged under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and
examine, among other things, the

288

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

reasonableness or prudence of the operation and maintenance practices, level
of expenditures, allowed rates of return and rate base, and previously
incurred capital expenditures. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the
subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge
with respect to System Energy’s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback
arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, and a separate
request for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement. Entergy cannot predict the outcome of any of these
proceedings nor can it predict whether any outcome could have a material
effect on Entergy’s or System Energy’s results of operations, financial
condition or liquidity. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further
discussion of the proceedings. System Energy has received FERC acceptance for
billing protocols to provide retail regulators with information regarding
rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

  

The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as
a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an
upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure
investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could
result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of,
cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and
formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2
to the financial statements.

  

Changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric
generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and related
activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies’
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and their utility
businesses.

  

If legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the
Utility operating companies’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated
customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows could be materially affected.
Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed
energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and together
with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these
technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies.
Such loss of sales could put upward pressure on rates, resulting in adverse
regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. Entergy and the Utility
operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes
in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the
cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these
changes on their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

  

The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated
costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or
disallowance in regulatory proceedings.

  

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and
associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to
periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can
result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently
incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators
experience outages or when planned outages are extended, with the possibility
of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of
those costs, particularly when there are substantial or sudden increases in
such costs. Regulators also may initiate proceedings to investigate the
continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power
recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can
be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in
effect at all.

  

The Utility operating companies’ cash flows can be negatively affected by the
time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and
the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when
the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very
dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer
recovery of a portion of that period’s fuel and purchased power costs for
recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital
and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and
purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory
proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the
financial statements.

There remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the
System Agreement on the Utility operating companies.

  

The Utility operating companies historically engaged in the coordinated
planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk
transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a
rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC. The System Agreement
terminated in its entirety on August 31, 2016.

  

There remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of
the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the
significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission
functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of
time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. In the absence of the
System Agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of
governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve
certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail
regulators.

  

In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in
August 2016, there are a few outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the
FERC and at the D.C. Circuit that may require future adjustments, including
challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under
the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and
resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.

  

For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the
System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

  

The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with
participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade
costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system
pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO’s
wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design
changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with,
existing or future regulations or requirements.

  

On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO
RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems
of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets
for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating
companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and
ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and
offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the
MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and
market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks
associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and
system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility
operating companies’ ability to sell capacity, energy, and/or ancillary
services in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, or the
cost of serving the Utility operating companies’ respective loads, and MISO
market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk.

  

The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission
planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions
that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility
operating companies’ transmission assets that are under MISO’s functional
control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect
the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not
own, which could increase cash or financing needs. In addition to the cash and
financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation
to the Utility operating companies from transmission projects of others, there
is a risk that the Utility operating companies’ business and financial
position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and
other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being
approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission
systems. Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including
provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the

290

* * *

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of
return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are
subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating
companies’ transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their
participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by
regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future
inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In
addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies’ respective
retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make
periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making
of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and
benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and
benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their
continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically
by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective
retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the
Utility operating companies’ continued membership in MISO.

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

  

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred
as a result of severe weather (including from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane
Delta, and Hurricane Zeta), or the impact on customer bills of permitted storm
cost recovery, could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility
operating companies.

  

Entergy’s and its Utility operating companies’ results of operations,
liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the
destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in
significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and,
therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the
period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm
restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather
could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies
affected by severe weather. In addition, the recovery of major storm
restoration costs from customers could effectively limit our ability to make
planned capital or other investments due to the impact of such storm cost
recovery on customer bills.

  

In August and October 2020, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta caused significant damage to portions of the Utility’s service
territories in Louisiana, including New Orleans, Texas, and to a lesser
extent, in Arkansas and Mississippi. The storms resulted in widespread power
outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure,
and the loss of sales during the outages. Additionally, as a result of
Hurricane Laura’s extensive damage to the grid infrastructure serving the
impacted area, large portions of the underlying transmission system required
nearly a complete rebuild. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or
replacement of the electrical system damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane
Delta, and Hurricane Zeta are currently estimated to be approximately $2.4
billion. Because Entergy has not gone through the regulatory process regarding
these storm costs, there is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to
predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery
initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover,
or the timing of such recovery.

  

Nuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at
high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors
could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

  

Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of
certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale
Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating

291

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate
its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety
requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants,
lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected
companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their
owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in
the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly
affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’
forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some
degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts
guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these
contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would
be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale
Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis,
which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease.
Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk.

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy periodically shut
down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and
upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling
outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy’s
and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be
materially affected.

  

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be
“turned off.” Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18
to 24 months. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such
planned outages, which typically extends the planned outage duration. When
refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences
unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may
increase.

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face risks
related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and
fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy’s and their results
of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

  

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy’s nuclear units have a
diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially
adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what
Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2020 and beyond.
Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices,
however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While
there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to
mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate
uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium
supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers
located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases
from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that
sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile
from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due
to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or limitations on
importation of uranium or uranium products from foreign countries, or shifting
trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract
portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years,
costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to
normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially
affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of
certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy.

  

Entergy’s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the
performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication
services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium
suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its
supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a
reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For
fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the
fabricator of that plant’s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon
additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to
assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers
and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as
Russia, in which international sanctions or tariffs could further restrict the
ability of such

292

suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable
prices or at all. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to
perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial
condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating
companies and System Energy.

  

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its
regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their
nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

  

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates
the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke
licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure
to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the
licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which
could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act,
other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the
NRC’s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital
expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and
could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial
condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility
operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a
plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC’s Reactor Oversight
Process, which is the NRC’s program to collect information about plant
performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide
for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the
plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased
oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in
classification. For additional information concerning the current
classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see “Regulation
of Entergy’s Business \- Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry \- NRC
Reactor Oversight Process” in Part I, Item 1.

  

Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those
owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of
the applicable licenses, or the NRC’s interpretation thereof, or may cause the
NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or
revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a
result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether
an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain
of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale
Commodities.

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and
maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain
operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect
Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

  

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating
companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began
commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more
capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating
safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic
upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure
associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital
expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be
fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in
regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence.
Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by
Entergy’s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit
needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to
happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and
expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense
of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility
operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs
being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory
proceedings. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost
revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet

293

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts
with customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy’s
nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that
can result in increased costs.

  

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of
stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials
within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying
degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and
guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation
strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the
nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be
quantified in advance.

  

Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts
of Entergy’s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished,
and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-
engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-
times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on
a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for
unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified
replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy.

  

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of
the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their
ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be
significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel
disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site
storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national
repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed
for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of
such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-
site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by
law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is
granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of
spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively
at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is
removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its
objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the
DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will
commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal.
As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent
fuel storage capacity at the companies’ nuclear sites and maintenance costs on
existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks,
may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory
requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository
or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the
ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to
decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the
“Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs – Spent Fuel
Disposal” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for
Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to
the financial statements.

  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial
retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a
nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material
effect on Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity.

  

Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred
both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each
reactor owner’s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to
the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which
is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6
million per reactor. With 97 reactors currently

294

* * *

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of
approximately $14 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to
account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of
insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As
required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System
Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount
of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear
Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any
nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial
Protection. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes
damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of
a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy’s Utility operating companies,
System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless
of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective
premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary
insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor
per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is
$1.101 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to
approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the
aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million
cap.

  

NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members,
including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. All member plants could be subject
to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current
annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be
significantly depleted due to insured losses. As of December 31, 2020, the
maximum annual assessment amounts total $104 million for the Utility plants.
Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty
can cover the potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities
plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those
potential assessments.

  

As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-
insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by
a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a
nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and
require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program
that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial
condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating
companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries.

  

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by
the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning
obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of
assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy’s nuclear
power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the
plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory
requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding.

  

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those
plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners
of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain
decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating
companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the
trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those
rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are
generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well
as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these
trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns
that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting
from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in
these trust funds.

  

Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-
required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific
estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant’s
decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial
assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license
expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent

295

* * *

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of
decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount
of each individual plant’s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required
decommissioning amount, then its NRC license termination decommissioning
obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If
the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to
decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate,
or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to
require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be
required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the
trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for
related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not
included in the NRC’s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the
provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to
NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for
certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which
management believes it will be able to satisfy.

  

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in
decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for
decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or
accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the
decommissioning of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy
Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the
decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning
trusts. Such changes also could result in the need for additional
contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees,
letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. As a result, under any of these
circumstances, Entergy’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial
condition could be materially affected.

  

An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current
expectations), poor investment results, or higher than anticipated
decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory
requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the
decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating
companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant
owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit
support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with
respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from
customers in a timely fashion or at all.

  

For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management’s
decision to exit the merchant power business, the impairment charges that
resulted from such decision, and the planned sales of Palisades and Indian
Point Energy Center (which, in each case, will include the transfer of the
associated decommissioning trusts), see the “Critical Accounting Estimates \-
Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” section of Management’s Financial Discussion
and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy, the “Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power
Business” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9 and 14 to the financial
statements.

  

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and
nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning
of Entergy’s nuclear power plants.

  

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the
safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. These concerns have led
to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and
governing bodies in some localities where Entergy’s subsidiaries own nuclear
generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the
shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to
spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse
effects on owning, operating, and decommissioning nuclear generating units.
Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the
existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect
to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a
material effect on Entergy’s results of operations and financial condition.

(Entergy Corporation)

  

Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return
on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. As a result, the sale
of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power
plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market
power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy
Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD
and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of
December 31, 2020, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power generation
plants had sold forward 98% in 2021 and 99% in 2022 of its generation
portfolio’s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown and sale of
the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022.

  

Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio
considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations
under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is
operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is
not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there
is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power
purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails
to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit
to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD
sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a
portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to
the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed
contract prices.

  

Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short
periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or
decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate
dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During
periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time
there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with
jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation
rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules, and
other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.

  

The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure
challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power
regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are
located. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants
operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their
environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. These conditions were
primary factors leading to Entergy’s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy
Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants before the end of their operating
licenses.

  

The price that different counterparties offer for various products including
forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract
terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number
of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward
period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of
contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contract
portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market
prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly
affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial
condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling
forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a
falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising
price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs
will also affect these results. See the “Market and Credit Risk Sensitive
Instruments” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has
announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale
Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such
plants.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative,
regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any
future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or
requirements.

  

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation
under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under
these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities
business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with
such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility,
the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.

  

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC
acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of
the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that
generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a
“public utility” under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale
sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission
facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing
companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s
orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power
marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or
revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or
generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate
transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based
sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its
generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of
those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits
associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-
based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1.29 million per day
per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power
marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such
companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-
service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-
keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-
based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities.

  

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and
regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules,
tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing
Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee
most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue
to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other
mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of
market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other
regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ generation facilities that sell energy
and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information
regarding federal, state, and local laws and regulation applicable to the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the “Regulation of Entergy’s
Business” section in Part I, Item 1.

  

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is
subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state
and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale
power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment
will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some
of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design
changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have
raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy
prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear
power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a
generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce
their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative
or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may
delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material
changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the
electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are
subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a
material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity.

  

Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of
these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is
based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the
operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the expected
operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the
assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units,
and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining
life of the assets. In particular, the remaining assets of the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection
with the closure and sale of its nuclear power plants. Moreover, prior to the
closure and sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows,
an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a
reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, or a decline in
observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional
impairment charges for the affected assets.

  

If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to
operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on
a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment
of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken
by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the remaining
power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely
be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a
material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for
impairment, see the “Critical Accounting Estimates \- Impairment of Long-lived
Assets” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment
charges, see Note 14 to the financial statements.

  

General Business

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

  

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital
markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could
make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural
disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the
capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy’s and its
subsidiaries’ ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and
grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.

  

Entergy’s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to
access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also
spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the
liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy’s and the Utility operating
companies’ liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a
hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that
experienced in Entergy’s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and
Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane
Isaac in 2012, and Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta in
2020. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in
regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration
costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow
from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy
(including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the
financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition,
accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may
result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could
negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating
companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital
markets.

The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times
of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital
markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to
maintain and to expand their businesses. Access to capital markets could be
restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of
debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in companies that experience
extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels or offerings to fund fossil
fuel projects, or due to risks related to climate change. Events beyond
Entergy’s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of
capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the
ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries
are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or
replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the
size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable
to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its
subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that
are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term
securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could
impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings,
significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation’s
ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

  

A downgrade in Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could
negatively affect Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to
access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to
post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.

  

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at
credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant
Subsidiaries, including each Registrant’s regulatory framework, ability to
recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and
liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation’s, any
of the Utility operating companies’, or System Energy’s ratings, particularly
below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of
investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of
credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of
commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.

  

Most of Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ suppliers and
counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions.
If Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ ratings decline, particularly
below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy
Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and
demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the
counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit,
prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or
counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020 based on power prices at that time, Entergy
had liquidity exposure of $62 million under the guarantees in place supporting
Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $6 million of posted cash
collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating
to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2020,
Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of
additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of
December 31, 2020, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale
Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted
collateral from counterparties, would increase by $22 million for a $1 per
MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.

  

Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy’s
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and CARES Act of 2020 significantly changed
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by,
among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting
interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The
interpretive

guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with
Entergy’s own interpretation and the legislation could be subject to
amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation.

  

As further described in Note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of
amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes and payment of such amounts
to customers in 2019, Entergy’s net regulatory liability for income taxes
balance is $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. Depending on the outcome of
IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy
and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges
or credits to income tax expense. Further, there may be other material effects
resulting from the legislation that have not been identified.

  

See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 2018, 2019 and 2020 results of operations and
financial condition, the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the
uncertainties associated with accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and
Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the regulatory
proceedings that have considered the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

  

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying
potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s,
the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax
effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their
obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income,
franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These
judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax
positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate
their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of
carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the
financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse
tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its
subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy’s, the Utility operating
companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition,
and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy’s income taxes, see
Note 3 to the financial statements.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to successfully execute on their
business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic
transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be
unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies,
which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations,
and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries’ future prospects and results of operations
significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business
strategies, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic, and other
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. As a result,
Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated
results of such strategies.

  

Additionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to
pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture,
joint venture, restructuring, or other strategic transactions. For example,
Entergy has entered into an agreement to sell its equity interests in the
subsidiary that owns the Palisades Nuclear Plant and the decommissioned Big
Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant and an agreement to sell the equity interests
of Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, in each case after each
of the plants has been shut down and defueled. Also, a significant portion of
Entergy’s utility business over the next several years includes the
construction and/or purchase of a variety of generating units. These
transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and
other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these
transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a
timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’
financial condition or results of operations and the market’s perception of
Entergy’s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and
any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks,
including the following:

  

301

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings, or cash
flow at anticipated levels;

•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting, or other
problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;

•Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not
disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to
indemnification from the seller are limited;

•Entergy may experience issues integrating businesses into its internal
controls over financial reporting;

•the disposition of a business, including Entergy’s planned exit from the
merchant power business, could divert management’s attention from other
business concerns;

•Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary
regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals
may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable, or Entergy or its
subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory
treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and

•Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full
strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or
such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any
other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a
business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a
material effect on their business, financial condition or results of
operations.

  

The completion of capital projects, including the construction of power
generation facilities, and other capital improvements involve substantial
risks. Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies
could be materially affected.

  

Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ ability to complete capital
projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make
other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent
upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include,
but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for
materials, labor, and environmental compliance, and reliance on suppliers for
timely and satisfactory performance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in
materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition,
suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their
contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to
fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of
projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability
to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting
revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy,
changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements,
and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect
the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or
other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost
overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could
incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of
potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility
operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility,
which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective
regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new
generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest
reasonable cost.

  

For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of
capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential
construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within
the Utility operating companies’ service territory, and as to the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business, see the “Capital Expenditure Plans and Other
Uses of Capital” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for
Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries.

Failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce
could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries’ results of operations.

  

We rely on a large and changing workforce of team members, including
employees, contractors and temporary staffing. Certain events, such as an
aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately
anticipate future workforce needs, or the unavailability of contract resources
may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include
lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, and the time required for skill
development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace
employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire
and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and
cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate
the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with
nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized,
technology-enabled power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to
successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce,
their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be
negatively affected.

  

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations
related to environmental and other matters.

  

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive
environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws
and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies,
System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their
operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also
affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water,
wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and
service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species,
certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and
similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise
these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to
judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion
vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for
facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel,
and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements
can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to
bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or
operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs,
civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or
property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In
addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under
these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of
property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies,
System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated
by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies
currently are involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous
substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in
the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy
Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant
costs related to environmental compliance.

  

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse
gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants potentially
are subject to increased regulation, controls, and mitigation expenses. In
addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often
are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes
resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the
resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending
on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change,
initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water
availability issues are discussed below.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all
required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining
any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its
subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the
operation of its facilities could be

stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information
regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business – Environmental Regulation” section of Part
I, Item 1.

  

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability
standards.

  

Entergy’s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability
standards. Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and
other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently
are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards
could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential
exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The
standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject
to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the
implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines,
the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant
costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards,
including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission
system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the
Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have
exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable
operation of the Utility operating companies’ distribution systems, including
penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability
standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy
cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on
its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses.

  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

  

Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors
may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise
materially affect the Utility operating companies’ results of operations and
system reliability.

  

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric
cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the
winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a
corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage
and resulting revenues. Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal
pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to
report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the
other quarters. Extreme weather conditions including hurricanes or tropical
storms, flooding events, or ice storms may stress the Utility operating
companies’ generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems,
resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased
financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand,
increased regulatory oversight, and reduced customer satisfaction. These
extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating
companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

  

Entergy’s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors
including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new
technologies, and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and
ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that
greatly reduce their grid demand. Some of these factors are inherently
cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions,
and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy’s operating results. Others,
such as the organic turnover of appliances and their replacement with more
efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats,
new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side
management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing
sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging
efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose
customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and
commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further
limit sales growth in the future. The Utility operating companies also may
face competition from other companies offering products and services to
Entergy’s customers. Electricity sales to industrial

304

customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable
commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in
conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Negative changes in
any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or
sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales
declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect
Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity.

  

The effects of climate change, environmental and regulatory obligations
intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase clean or
renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions,
or achieving voluntary climate commitments could materially affect the
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the
Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business.

  

In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and
local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at
known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the
United States Supreme Court’s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority
to regulate emissions of CO2 and other “greenhouse gases” under the Clean Air
Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations
focused considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation
facilities and their potential role in climate change. Since that ruling, the
EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from
certain vehicles, and from new, existing, and significantly modified
stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. As
examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and
requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions,
and a similar program has been developed in California. In Louisiana, the
Office of the Governor announced the creation of a Climate Initiatives Task
Force and issued an executive order that established a path to net-zero
emissions by 2050 while the City Council of New Orleans passed a renewable and
clean portfolio standard that sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 and
absolute zero emissions by 2050. The impact that continued changes in the
governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending
environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is
currently unclear.

  

Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions
reduction, clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary
climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation
and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic
position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low
or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than
expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher
emitting units, thus increasing the company’s greenhouse gas emission rate.
Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be
negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations
change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead
to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized
markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or
Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may
subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to
enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into
compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve
compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged
health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or
standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable
in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be
resisted by Entergy’s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy’s regulators
might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes
in regulation or policies governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse
gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional
costs to Entergy’s utility operating companies, their suppliers or customers,
(ii) make some of Entergy’s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain
or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and
stranded costs if Entergy’s utility operating companies are unable to fully
recover the costs and investment in generation and (iv) could increase the
difficulty that Entergy and its utility operating companies have with
obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of
which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations,
and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have
occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases
alleging that these

305

* * *

Table of Contents

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

  

companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by
climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary
compensation, and punitive damages.

  

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate
change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include
an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wildfires, wetland and
barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions,
(such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average
temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions
or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are
at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss
of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the
nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible
to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate
change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes.
Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could
impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.

  

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand,
increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation
facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased
maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs),
limits on the Entergy System’s ability to meet peak customer demand, more
frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, and lower
customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely
impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or
demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and
revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on
Entergy’s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’, System Energy’s, and the Utility
operating companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and
liquidity.

  

In September 2020, Entergy voluntarily committed to achieving net zero carbon
emissions by 2050. Technology research and development, innovation, and
advancement are critical to Entergy’s ability to achieve this commitment.
Moreover, Entergy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving this
objective, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability,
or its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

  

Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process,
and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of
operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy,
and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

  

Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility
operating companies’, System Energy’s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’
business operations. Entergy’s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-
up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy’s Utility
operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities.
Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy’s business
operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact
both operations and revenues.

  

Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface
waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and
conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy
also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge
permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state
water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both
water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in
times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low
groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of
water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population
growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may
cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in
commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy’s and its
subsidiaries’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

  

To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price
fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating
companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into
contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel
requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and
enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established
risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its
subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase
and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in
the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its
subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and
positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In
addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years
unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions,
fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy’s and its
subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position.

  

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these
risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated
with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its
subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management
decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial
position.

  

Entergy’s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules
implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and protect
against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not
fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity
price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such
rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure,
as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging
activities.

  

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the
obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in
Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ credit quality or changes in the market prices
of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral
required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management
activities, which could materially affect Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’
liquidity and financial position.

  

The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business
are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations,
which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy
Wholesale Commodities.

  

The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies
and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that
counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other
commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging
agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide
credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its
subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform,
Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the
credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which
credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In
such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to
amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit
commitments of Entergy’s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored
for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress
affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its
liquidity sources.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan
assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased
benefit plan costs.

  

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held
in trust under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline
in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements
relating to Entergy’s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher
benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the “expected return on
assets” component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits
costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over
time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has
affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy’s planned
levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates
affect the liabilities under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit
plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially
requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying
costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension
benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other
factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal
regulations. For further information regarding Entergy’s pension and other
postretirement benefit plans, refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates –
Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” section of Management’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant
Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements.

  

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries
operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business
in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous
material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other
matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate have
proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these
states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including
punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and
business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate
means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the
litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.

  

Terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of
Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ or our suppliers’ technology systems may
adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations.

  

Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving
information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection,
processing systems, software, network infrastructure, and other technologies
that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and
prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of
Entergy’s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers’ and their
contractors’ technology. Suppliers’ and their contractors’ technology systems
to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of
business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i)
intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally
identifiable information of customers and employees, and (iv) data with
respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement,
and supply chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such
information technology systems could result in loss of data or disruptions of
operations.

  

There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by
cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. As an
operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face
heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, cyber attacks, and data
breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy’s
generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers,
infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and
transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions. An
actual act could affect Entergy’s ability to operate, including its ability to
operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which
it relies to conduct business.

  

Given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats,
Entergy’s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite
implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security

and controls. If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were
compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal
state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform
critical business functions that are essential to the company’s well-being and
could result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary
information, including personal information of its customers, employees,
suppliers, and others in Entergy’s care.

  

Any such attacks, failures or data breaches could have a material effect on
Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition,
results of operations or reputation. Although we purchase insurance coverage
for cyber-attacks or data breaches, such insurance may not be adequate to
cover all losses that might arise in connection with these events. Such events
may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated
damages and fines).

  

(Entergy New Orleans)

  

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas
service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans’s results of operations and
liquidity.

  

Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased
gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans,
and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility.
Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are
affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. When purchased gas cost
charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may
decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution
charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of
operations. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer’s
bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy
New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans’s cash flows can
be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and
the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs.

  

(System Energy)

  

System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear
generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for
all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System
Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of
ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings.

  

System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the
capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90%
ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for
their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful
economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its
operating license, which expires in November 2044. System Energy’s financial
condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating
companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial
operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the
subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge
with respect to System Energy’s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback
arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, and a request
in a separate proceeding for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The LPSC has also authorized the filing
of a prudence complaint at the FERC relating to Grand Gulf operations. Entergy
cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings nor can it predict
whether any outcome could have a material effect on Entergy’s or System
Energy’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. See Note 2
to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The
Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for
providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement.

  

For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and
leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy
System companies’ support of System Energy, see Notes 5 and 8 to the

financial statements and the “Utility \- System Energy and Related Agreements”
section of Part I, Item 1.

  

(Entergy Corporation)

  

As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from
its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and
to pay dividends on its common stock.

  

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating
operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its
subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its
subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation’s ability to satisfy its financial
obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its
outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the
payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The
subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities
and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make
distributions to Entergy Corporation. The ability of such subsidiaries to make
payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation depends on their
results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained
earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations
on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Prior to
providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and
regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt
service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas,
dividends and distributions on preferred securities. Any distributions from
the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy are
paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to
prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

The COVID-19 Pandemic

  

See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

See the “February 2021 Winter Storms” section of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion
of the February 2021 winter storms. Entergy Arkansas’s preliminary estimate
for the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring power is approximately $10
million. Natural gas purchases for Entergy Arkansas for February 1st through
25th, 2021 are approximately $105 million compared to natural gas purchases
for February 2020 of $10 million.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income decreased $17.7 million primarily due to lower volume/weather, a
formula rate plan provision recorded in 2020 to reflect the 2019 historical
year netting adjustment, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses,
partially offset by higher retail electric price and lower other operation and
maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of
the 2019 historical year netting adjustment.

  

Operating Revenues

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2020 to
2019:

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $2,259.6 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income |  |  |  |  | |
|(278.5) |  |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | (72.2) |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | 57.4 |  |  |  | |
|Return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers | 118.2 |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | $2,084.5 |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy Arkansas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to
recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and
expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net
income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net
income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 1,069 GWh, or
5%, in billed electricity usage, including decreased commercial and industrial
usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of less favorable
weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by an increase
in residential usage as a

result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” section of
Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and
Analysis for discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the $56.5 million
annual formula rate plan increase related to the 2020 projected test year
included in the 2019 formula rate plan filing effective with the first billing
cycle of January 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further
discussion of the formula rate plan filing.

  

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to
customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred
income taxes through a tax adjustment rider beginning in April 2018. In 2020,
$8.1 million was returned to customers as compared to $126.3 million in 2019.
There is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues in
each period was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the
financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

  

Other Income Statement Variances

  

Nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization
of lower costs associated with the most recent outages as compared to previous
outages.

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $18.3 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to
lower nuclear labor costs, including contract labor, in part as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic;

•a decrease of $13.2 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due
to lower long-term service agreement expenses;

•an $11.2 million write-off in 2019 of specific costs related to the potential
construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant. See Note 2 to the
financial statements for discussion of the write-off;

•higher nuclear insurance refunds of $7.8 million;

•a decrease of $5.9 million primarily due to contract costs in 2019 related to
initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and

•a decrease of $5.8 million in energy efficiency costs.

  

The decrease was partially offset by the effects of recording in 2019 a final
judgment to resolve claims in the ANO damages case against the DOE related to
spent nuclear fuel storage costs. The damages awarded include the
reimbursement of approximately $11.9 million of spent nuclear fuel storage
costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense. See Note
8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel
litigation.

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to
plant in service.

  

Other income increased primarily due to changes in decommissioning trust fund
investment activity.

  

Other regulatory credits - net for 2020 includes a provision of $43.5 million
to reflect the 2019 historical year netting adjustment included in the APSC’s
December 2020 order in the 2020 formula rate plan proceeding. See Note 2 to
the financial statements for discussion of the 2020 formula rate plan
proceeding.

  

The effective income tax rates were 16.3% for 2020 and (21.6%) for 2019. The
difference in the effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate
of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated
deferred income taxes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a
discussion of the effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the
federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $17.9 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs;

•lower collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic; and

•the timing of payments to vendors.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income
taxes to customers in 2020 as compared to 2019. See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act;

•$25 million in proceeds received from the DOE in 2020 resulting from
litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously
expensed. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent
nuclear fuel litigation; and

•a decrease of $15.8 million in pension contributions in 2020. See “Critical
Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a
discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $119.4 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $79.5 million in storm spending;

•an increase of $47.3 million in non-nuclear generation construction
expenditures primarily due to increased spending on various projects in 2020;

•an increase of $39.4 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily
as a result of work performed in 2020 on various ANO 2 outage projects;

•an increase of $38.5 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel
activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of
fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and service
deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

•an increase of $30.3 million in distribution construction expenditures
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy
Arkansas’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced
metering infrastructure.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease of $56 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily
due to a lower scope of work performed in 2020 as compared to 2019; and

•$55 million in proceeds received from the DOE in 2020 resulting from
litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously
capitalized. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the
spent nuclear fuel litigation.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $322.6 million in
2020 primarily due to:

  

•issuances of $100 million of 4.0% Series mortgage bonds in March 2020 and
$675 million of 2.65% Series mortgage bonds in September 2020;

•money pool activity;

•a decrease of $41.6 million in net long-term repayments in 2020 on the
Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit
facility; and

•a decrease of $20 million in common equity distributions in 2020 in order to
maintain Entergy Arkansas’s capital structure.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•the issuance of $350 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;

•the repayment in October 2020 of $200 million of 4.90% Series mortgage bonds
due December 2052; and

•the repayment in October 2020 of $125 million of 4.75% Series mortgage bonds
due June 2063.

  

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash
flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $21.6
million in 2020 compared to decreasing by $161.1 million in 2019. The money
pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility
subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

  

See Note 5 to the financial statements for further details of long-term debt.

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital
Resources \- Cash Flow” in Item 7 of Entergy Arkansas’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21,
2020, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow
activities for 2019 compared to 2018.

  

Capital Structure

  

Entergy Arkansas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The
increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the net issuances of
long-term debt in 2020.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 54.8 | % |  | 53.0 | %
Effect of subtracting cash | (1.2 | %) |  | — | %
Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 53.6 | % |  | 53.0 | %
  
  

(a)Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to
Entergy Arkansas.

  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of
short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt,
including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity.
Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy
Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in
analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information
to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial
condition because the securitization bonds, which have been repaid as of
December 31, 2020, were non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, as more fully
described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy Arkansas also uses
the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing
its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its
investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition
because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas’s outstanding debt position that
could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

  

Entergy Arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with
its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital
structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support
planned investments, Entergy Arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce
distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in
certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that
would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt
and reducing distributions, Entergy Arkansas may receive equity contributions
to maintain its capital structure.

  

Uses of Capital

  

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
costs; and

•distribution and interest payments.

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5
to the financial statements.

(b)Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or
cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.
For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel
and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement, which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial
statements.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Arkansas
currently expects to contribute approximately $66.6 million to its qualified
pension plans and approximately $517 thousand to its other postretirement
health care and life insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required
pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1,
2021 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See
“Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement
benefits funding.

  

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $252
million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes
for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably
estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax
positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information
regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

  

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned
capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas includes specific investments
in renewables such as the Searcy Solar Facility, Walnut Bend Solar Facility,
and West Memphis Solar Facility; transmission projects to enhance reliability,
reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to
enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced
meters and related investments; resource planning, including potential
generation and renewables projects; system improvements; investments in ANO 1
and 2; software and security; and other investments. Estimated capital
expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy
Arkansas pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined
monthly.

  

Renewables

  

Searcy Solar Facility

  

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an agreement for the
purchase of an approximately 100 MW solar energy facility that will be sited
on approximately 800 acres in White County near Searcy, Arkansas. The purchase
is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals from
applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. The project
is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. Entergy
Arkansas will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the
other purchase contingencies have been met. Closing is expected to occur by
the end of 2021. In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC
seeking a finding that the transaction is in the public interest and
requesting all necessary approvals. In September 2019 other parties filed
testimony largely supporting the resource acquisition but disputing Entergy
Arkansas’s proposed method of cost recovery. Entergy Arkansas filed its
rebuttal testimony in October 2019. In February 2020, Entergy Arkansas, the
Attorney General, and the APSC general staff filed a partial settlement
agreement asking the APSC to approve, based on the record in the proceeding,
all issues except certain issues that are submitted to the APSC for
determination. In April 2020 the APSC issued an order approving Entergy
Arkansas’s acquisition of the Searcy Solar facility as being in the public
interest, but declined to approve Entergy Arkansas’s preferred cost recovery
rider mechanism, finding instead, based on the particular facts and
circumstances presented, that the formula rate plan rider was a sufficient
recovery mechanism for this resource.

  

Walnut Bend Solar Facility

  

In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a
finding that the purchase of the 100 MW Walnut Bend Solar Facility is in the
public interest. Entergy Arkansas requested a decision by the APSC by June 15,
2021 and primarily requests cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider.
A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in April 2021.
Closing is expected to occur in 2022.

  

West Memphis Solar Facility

  

In January 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a
finding that the purchase of the 180 MW West Memphis Solar Facility is in the
public interest. Entergy Arkansas requested a decision by the APSC by
September 7, 2021 and primarily requests cost recovery through the formula
rate plan rider. Closing is expected to occur in 2023.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2018 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year. The filing showed
Entergy Arkansas’s projected earned return on common equity for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 test period to be below the formula rate plan
bandwidth. Additionally, the filing included the first netting adjustment
under the current formula rate plan for the historical test year 2017,
reflecting the change in formula rate plan revenues associated with actual
2017 results when compared to the allowed rate of return on equity. The filing
included a projected $73.4 million revenue deficiency for 2019 and a $95.6
million revenue deficiency for the 2017 historical test year, for a total
revenue requirement of $169 million for this filing. By operation of the
formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is

318

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy
Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the
resulting increase was limited to four percent of total revenue, which
originally was $65.4 million but was increased to $66.7 million based upon the
APSC staff’s updated calculation of 2018 revenue. In October 2018, Entergy
Arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed joint motions to approve a
partial settlement agreement as to certain factual issues and agreed to brief
contested legal issues. In November 2018 the APSC held a hearing and was
briefed on a contested legal issue. In December 2018 the APSC issued a
decision related to the initial legal brief, approved the partial settlement
agreement and $66.7 million revenue requirement increase, as well as Entergy
Arkansas’s formula rate plan, with updated rates going into effect for the
first billing cycle of January 2019.

  

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2019 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2020 calendar year. The filing
contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year
2020 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2018. The total proposed
formula rate plan rider revenue change designed to produce a target rate of
return on common equity of 9.75% is $15.3 million, which is based upon a
deficiency of approximately $61.9 million for the 2020 projected year, netted
with a credit of approximately $46.6 million in the 2018 historical year
netting adjustment. During 2018 Entergy Arkansas experienced higher-than
expected sales volume, and actual costs were lower than forecasted. These
changes, coupled with a reduced income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, resulted in the credit for the historical year netting
adjustment. In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Arkansas recorded a provision
of $35.1 million that reflected the estimate of the historical year netting
adjustment that was expected to be included in the 2019 filing. In 2019,
Entergy Arkansas recorded additional provisions totaling $11.5 million to
reflect the updated estimate of the historical year netting adjustment
included in the 2019 filing. In October 2019 other parties in the proceeding
filed their errors and objections requesting certain adjustments to Entergy
Arkansas’s filing that would reduce or eliminate Entergy Arkansas’s proposed
revenue change. Entergy Arkansas filed its response addressing the requested
adjustments in October 2019. In its response, Entergy Arkansas accepted
certain of the adjustments recommended by the General Staff of the APSC that
would reduce the proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change to $14
million. Entergy Arkansas disputed the remaining adjustments proposed by the
parties. In October 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement
agreement with the other parties in the proceeding seeking APSC approval of a
revised total formula rate plan rider revenue change of $10.1 million. In its
July 2019 formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas proposed to recover an
$11.2 million regulatory asset, amortized over five years, associated with
specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White
Bluff plant. Although Entergy Arkansas does not concede that the regulatory
asset lacks merit, for purposes of reaching a settlement on the total formula
rate plan rider amount, Entergy Arkansas agreed not to include the White Bluff
scrubber regulatory asset cost in the 2019 formula rate plan filing or future
filings. Entergy Arkansas recorded a write-off in 2019 of the $11.2 million
White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset. In December 2019 the APSC approved the
settlement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s
compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2020.

  

2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2020 formula rate plan
filing to set its formula rate for the 2021 calendar year. The filing
contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year
2021, as amended through subsequent filings in the proceeding, and a netting
adjustment for the historical year 2019. The filing showed that Entergy
Arkansas’s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2021 projected year
is 8.22% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $64.3 million. The earned rate
of return on common equity for the 2019 historical year was 9.07% resulting in
a $23.9 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the
2021 projected year and 2019 historical year netting adjustment was $88.2
million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of
the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue
constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing
exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $74.3 million.
In October 2020 other parties in the proceeding filed their errors

319

and objections recommending certain adjustments, and Entergy Arkansas filed
responsive testimony disputing these adjustments. As part of the formula rate
plan tariff the calculation for the revenue constraint was updated based on
actual revenues which had the effect of reducing the initially-proposed $74.3
million revenue requirement increase to $72.6 million. In October 2020,
Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a unanimous settlement agreement reached
with the other parties that resolved all but one issue. As a result of the
settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas’s requested revenue increase was $68.4
million, including a $44.5 million increase for the projected 2021 year and a
$23.9 million netting adjustment. The remaining issue litigated concerned the
methodology used to calculate the netting adjustment within the formula rate
plan. In December 2020 the APSC issued an order rejecting the netting
adjustment method used by Entergy Arkansas. Applying the approach ordered by
the APSC changed the netting adjustment for the 2019 historical year from a
$23.9 million deficiency to $43.5 million excess. Overall, the decision
reduced Entergy Arkansas’s revenue adjustment for 2021 to $1 million. In
December 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition for rehearing of the APSC’s
decision, and in January 2021 the APSC granted further consideration of
Entergy Arkansas’s petition. Based on the progress of the proceeding to date,
in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory liability of $43.5
million to reflect the netting adjustment for 2019, as included in the APSC’s
December 2020 order, which would be returned to customers in 2021. Also with
the formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas is requesting an extension of
the formula rate plan rider for a second five-year term. Decisions by the APSC
on the netting adjustment rehearing and the extension are expected in March
2021.

  

Internal Restructuring

  

In November 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed an application with the APSC seeking
authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer
of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Arkansas to a new
entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary
holding company. In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed a settlement, reached by
all parties in the APSC proceeding, resolving all issues. The APSC approved
the settlement agreement and restructuring in August 2018. Pursuant to the
settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas will credit retail customers $39.6
million over six years, beginning in 2019. Entergy Arkansas also received the
required FERC and NRC approvals.

In November 2018, Entergy Arkansas undertook a multi-step restructuring,
including the following:

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at the
aggregate redemption price of approximately $32.7 million.

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. converted from an Arkansas corporation to a Texas
corporation.

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy
Arkansas Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Arkansas
Power), and Entergy Arkansas Power assumed substantially all of the
liabilities of Entergy Arkansas, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger
under the TXBOC. Entergy Arkansas, Inc. remained in existence and held the
membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power.

•Entergy Arkansas, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy
Arkansas Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation). As a result
of the contribution, Entergy Arkansas Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

  

In December 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility
Property, Inc., and Entergy Arkansas Power then changed its name to Entergy
Arkansas, LLC. Entergy Arkansas, LLC holds substantially all of the assets,
and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Arkansas, Inc.
The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under
common control.

Production Cost Allocation Rider

  

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from
customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as
a result of the System Agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the
“System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings” section in Note 2 to the
financial statements.

  

Energy Cost Recovery Rider

  

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to
recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. The rider
utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for
the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an
energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up
adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges,
of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery
rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of
over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.

  

In January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its
upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014.
In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy
Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate
$65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in
2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident. Entergy Arkansas requested that
the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel
balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information
was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator
incident. In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to
retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance. In July 2017, Entergy
Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.
In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by
the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate
a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld
from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of
deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to certain
timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement. See the “ANO
Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews” section in Note 8 to the financial statements
for further discussion of the ANO stator incident.

  

In March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an
increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kWh to $0.01547 per kWh. The APSC staff
filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be
implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal
operation of the tariff. Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect
on March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff. In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney
General requested additional information to support certain of the costs
included in Entergy Arkansas’s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination.

  

In March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an
increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kWh to $0.01882 per kWh. The Arkansas
Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual redetermination
filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the
amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to
refund. Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were
questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential
implications of the Tax Act. Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney
General’s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining
to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider,
those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. Entergy
Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Act are appropriately
considered in the APSC’s separate proceeding regarding potential implications
of the tax law. The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General’s
filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas’s filing complied with the terms of
the energy cost recovery rider. The redetermined rate became effective with
the first billing cycle of April 2018. Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC
issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery
rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the
issues suggested by the Attorney General in the

321

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

proceeding. Following a period of discovery, the Attorney General filed a
supplemental response in October 2018 raising new issues with Entergy
Arkansas’s March 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of
the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further
investigation. Entergy Arkansas filed to dismiss the Attorney General’s
supplemental response, the APSC general staff filed a motion to strike the
Attorney General’s filing, and the Attorney General filed a supplemental
response disputing Entergy Arkansas and the APSC staff’s filing. Applicable
APSC rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic
audits of Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider. In late-2018 the APSC
general staff notified Entergy Arkansas it has initiated an audit of the 2017
fuel costs. The time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this
time.

  

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a
decrease from $0.01882 per kWh to $0.01462 per kWh and became effective with
the first billing cycle in April 2019. In March 2019 the Arkansas Attorney
General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual adjustment and included
with its filing a motion for investigation of alleged overcharges to customers
in connection with the FERC’s October 2018 order in the opportunity sales
proceeding. Entergy Arkansas filed its response to the Attorney General’s
motion in April 2019 in which Entergy Arkansas stated its intent to initiate a
proceeding to address recovery issues related to the October 2018 FERC order.
In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas initiated the opportunity sales recovery
proceeding, discussed below, and requested that the APSC establish that
proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may
assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC
October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales
proceeding. In June 2019 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s request and also
denied the Attorney General’s motion in the energy cost recovery proceeding
seeking an investigation into Entergy Arkansas’s annual energy cost recovery
rider adjustment and referred the evaluation of such matters to the
opportunity sales recovery proceeding.

  

In March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy
cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a
decrease from $0.01462 per kWh to $0.01052 per kWh. The redetermined rate
became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2020 through the normal
operation of the tariff.

  

Opportunity Sales Proceeding

  

In June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine
that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties:
(a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy
generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy
System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System
generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement
that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer
of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies. The LPSC’s
complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds. In
July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint
arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the
Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own
account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load
(or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company. The FERC
subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.

  

After a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010. The ALJ
found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales
to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the
same manner as joint account sales. The ALJ concluded that “shareholders”
should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along
with interest. Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial
decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.

  

The FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System
Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility
operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and
Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. The FERC found,
however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an
individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated

322

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different
allocation authority. The FERC further found that the after-the-fact
accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales
was inconsistent with the System Agreement. The FERC in its decision
established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the
opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC’s June 2012 decision. The
hearing was held in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August
2013. The LPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on
exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. Entergy filed a brief on
exceptions requesting that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief
opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff.

  

In April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed
in July 2012 and the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision. The first order
denied Entergy’s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC’s earlier rulings
that Entergy’s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the
opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make
payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same
position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation. The
FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments. The second
order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ’s August
2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to
calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility
operating companies. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s ruling that a full re-run of
intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be
modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy
allocation as joint account sales. The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision that
any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by 20%. The FERC also
reversed the ALJ’s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service
schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when
calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas. The FERC held that
such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account
but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address whether a cap on any
reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other
adjustments to the calculation methodology.

  

In May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC’s
April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be
reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC’s approval of certain contracts.
Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of
the FERC’s April 2016 order addressing the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.
The APSC and the LPSC also filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s April
2016 order.  In September 2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request
for rehearing on the issue of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the
other Utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the
LPSC’s approval of Entergy Arkansas’s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy
Louisiana. In November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the
remaining requests for rehearing of the April 2016 order. In November 2017,
Entergy Services filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC’s
orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case. In December 2017
the D.C. Circuit granted Entergy Services’ request to hold the appeal in
abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.
In January 2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in
the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy
Services’ appeal.

  

The hearing required by the FERC’s April 2016 order was held in May 2017. In
July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any
reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the
other adjustments to the calculation methodology. In August 2017 the Utility
operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual
briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision. In
September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC,
the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions
taken by various parties.

  

Based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the
April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a
liability of $87 million, which included interest, for its estimated increased
costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred
fuel regulatory asset of $75 million. Following its assessment of the course
of the proceedings, including the FERC’s denial of rehearing in

323

November 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas
recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31
million.

  

In October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ’s July 2017
initial decision. The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision to cap the reduction in
Entergy Arkansas’s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments
that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies. The FERC also
reversed the ALJ’s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through
September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s
payment. The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ’s rejection of the LPSC’s
claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the
calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment. In November 2018 the LPSC requested
rehearing of the FERC’s October 2018 decision. In December 2019 the FERC
denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing. In January 2020 the LPSC appealed the
December 2019 decision to the D.C. Circuit.

  

In December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC’s
October 2018 order. The compliance filing provided a final calculation of
Entergy Arkansas’s payments to the other Utility operating companies,
including interest. No protests were filed in response to the December 2018
compliance filing. The December 2018 compliance filing is pending FERC action.
Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to
the other operating companies in December 2018:

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Total refunds including interest |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Payment/(Receipt) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Principal | Interest | Total |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Arkansas | $68 | $67 | $135 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Louisiana | ($30) | ($29) | ($59) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Mississippi | ($18) | ($18) | ($36) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy New Orleans | ($3) | ($4) | ($7) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Entergy Texas | ($17) | ($16) | ($33) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of
$116 million as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a
result of this proceeding.

  

As described above, the FERC’s opportunity sales orders have been appealed to
the D.C. Circuit. In February 2020 all of the appeals were consolidated and in
April 2020 the D.C. Circuit established a briefing schedule. Briefing was
completed in September 2020 and oral argument was heard in December 2020.

  

In February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that
were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018
order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding. In March 2019,
Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint. In
November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC’s complaint. The order
concluded that the settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015
terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC’s new complaint. In December
2019 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s November 2019 order, and in
July 2020 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC’s request for
rehearing. In September 2020 the LPSC appealed to the D.C. Circuit the FERC’s
orders dismissing the new opportunity sales complaint. In November 2020 the
D.C. Circuit issued an order establishing that briefing will occur in January
2021 through April 2021.

  

In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony
with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the
costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period. The
application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30
days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the
rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring
30 days after issuance of the APSC’s order approving the rider. In June 2019
the APSC suspended

Entergy Arkansas’s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas’s motion asking the
APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which
interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate
treatment of the FERC’s October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the
opportunity sales proceeding. In January 2020 the APSC adopted a procedural
schedule with a hearing in April 2020. In January 2020 the Attorney General
and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a joint motion seeking to
dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s application alleging that the APSC, in a prior
proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined
that Entergy Arkansas’s requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and
the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking. Entergy Arkansas responded to
the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting these arguments, including
demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from
those the APSC addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a FERC
tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this
proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a FERC tariff
amendment that the APSC previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the
retroactive ratemaking grounds. In addition, in January 2020 the Attorney
General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing
the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also
claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and
refunded to customers. In March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed rebuttal
testimony.

  

In July 2020 the APSC issued a decision finding that Entergy Arkansas’s
application is not in the public interest. The order also directed Entergy
Arkansas to refund to its retail customers within 30 days of the order the
FERC-determined over-collection of $13.7 million, plus interest, associated
with a recalculated bandwidth remedy. In addition to these primary findings,
the order also denied the Attorney General’s request for Entergy Arkansas to
prepare a compliance filing detailing all of the retail impacts from the
opportunity sales and denied a request by the Arkansas Electric Energy
Consumers to recalculate all costs using the revised responsibility ratio.
Entergy Arkansas filed a motion for temporary stay of the 30-day requirement
to allow Entergy Arkansas a reasonable opportunity to seek rehearing of the
APSC order, but in July 2020 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for a
stay and directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers the
component of the total FERC-determined opportunity sales payment that was
associated with increased bandwidth remedy payments of $13.7 million, plus
interest. The refunds were issued in the August 2020 billing cycle. While the
APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s stay request, Entergy Arkansas believes its
actions were prudent and, therefore, the costs, including the $13.7 million,
plus interest, are recoverable. In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas requested
rehearing of the APSC order, which rehearing was denied by the APSC in August
2020. In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U. S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC’s
order denying Entergy Arkansas’s request to recover the costs of these
payments. In October 2020 the APSC filed a motion to dismiss Entergy
Arkansas’s complaint, to which Entergy Arkansas responded. Also in December
2020, Entergy Arkansas and the APSC held a pre-trial conference, and filed a
report with the court in January 2021. The court scheduled a hearing for
February 26, 2021 regarding issues addressed in the pre-trial conference
report.

  

Net Metering Legislation

  

An Arkansas law was enacted effective July 2019 that, among other things,
expands the definition of a “net metering customer” to include two additional
types of customers: (1) customers that lease net metering facilities, subject
to certain leasing arrangements, and (2) government entities or other entities
exempt from state and federal income taxes that enter into a service contract
for a net metering facility. The latter provision would allow eligible
entities, many of whom are small and large general service customers, to
purchase renewable energy directly from third party providers and receive bill
credits for these purchases. The APSC was given authority under this law to
address certain matters, such as cost shifting and the appropriate
compensation for net metered energy and has initiated proceedings for this
purpose. Because of the size and number of customers eligible under this new
law, there is a risk of loss of load and the shifting of costs to customers. A
hearing was held in December 2019, with utilities, cooperatives, the Arkansas
Attorney General, industrial customers, and Entergy Arkansas advocating the
need for establishment of a reasonable rate structure that takes into account
impacts to non-net metering customers; an additional hearing was conducted in
February 2020 for purposes of public comment only. The APSC issued an order in
June 2020, and in July 2020 several parties, including Entergy Arkansas, filed
for rehearing on multiple

325

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

grounds, including for the reasons that it imposes an unreasonable rate
structure and allows facilities to net meter that do not meet the statutory
definition of net metering facilities. After granting the rehearing requests,
the APSC issued an order in September 2020 largely upholding its June 2020
order. In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas and several other parties filed an
appeal of the APSC’s September 2020 order.

  

Separately, as directed by the APSC general staff, the APSC opened a
proceeding to compel utilities to amend their net metering tariffs to
incorporate the provisions of the legislation that the APSC general staff
considered “black letter law.” Entergy Arkansas, the Arkansas Attorney
General, and other intervenors opposed this directive pending the development
of the rules for implementation that are being considered in the separate net
metering rulemaking docket. Nevertheless, reserving its rights, Entergy
Arkansas has complied with the directive to amend its tariffs. Asserting
procedural and due process violations, in January 2020, Entergy Arkansas and
the Arkansas Attorney General separately appealed certain APSC orders in the
proceeding.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In April 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the APSC issued an order
requiring utilities, to the extent they had not already done so, to suspend
service disconnections during the remaining pendency of the Arkansas
Governor’s emergency declaration or until the APSC rescinds the directive. The
order also authorizes utilities to establish a regulatory asset to record
costs resulting from the suspension of service disconnections, directs that in
future proceedings the APSC will consider whether the request for recovery of
these regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, and requires utilities to
track and report the costs and any savings directly attributable to suspension
of disconnects. In May 2020 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas expanding
deferred payment agreements to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Quarterly reporting began in August 2020 and the APSC ordered additional
reporting in October 2020 regarding utilities’ transitional plans for ending
the moratorium on service disconnects. In February 2021 the APSC issued an
order finding that it is not in the public interest to immediately lift the
moratorium on service disconnects, but to announce a target date of May 3,
2021. In March 2021 the APSC will issue an order either confirming the lifting
of the moratorium on service disconnects or extending the moratorium. As of
December 31, 2020, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory asset of $10.5
million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a
discussion of federal regulation.

  

Nuclear Matters

  

Entergy Arkansas owns and, through an affiliate, operates the ANO 1 and ANO 2
nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks
related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks related
to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level
radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for
capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet
to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these
nuclear plants including the financial requirements to address emerging issues
like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems;
regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including
changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership,
operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of
interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear
waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of
nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete
decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and
types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with
nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.
In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2,
Entergy Arkansas may be required to

file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit
support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. ANO 1’s
operating license expires in 2034 and ANO 2’s operating license expires in
2038.

  

Environmental Risks

  

Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by
various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water
quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce
estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy
Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations.

  

In the first quarter 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its
estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and ANO 2 as a result of
a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimates resulted in a
$126.2 million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with
corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will
be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

  

Entergy Arkansas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs,
as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous
factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics,
and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.
See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical
Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s
estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Employer Contributions

  

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2020 was $81.7 million,
including $21.1 million in settlement costs. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2021
qualified pension cost to be $61.6 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $60
million to its qualified pension plans in 2020 and estimates pension
contributions will be approximately $66.6 million in 2021, although the 2021
required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the
January 1, 2021 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021.

  

Total other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for
Entergy Arkansas in 2020 was $10.1 million. Entergy Arkansas expects 2021
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately
$11.1 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $2.2 million to its other
postretirement plans in 2020 and estimates 2021 contributions will be
approximately $517 thousand.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the member and Board of Directors of

Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy
Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
member’s equity (pages 332 through 336 and applicable items in pages 51
through 238), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries — Refer to
Note 2 to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arkansas Public Service
Commission (the “APSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of
electric companies in Arkansas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it
meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the
specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.
Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial
statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment;

330

* * *

Table of Contents

regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes; operating revenues; operation
and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization expense.

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the APSC and the FERC set the rates the
Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a
reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that
require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation,
including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company
assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to
meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance
sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes
consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for
similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and
political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover
costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the APSC
and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing
utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility
business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery
in future rates of incurred costs, including costs related to the Opportunity
Sales Proceeding and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments
regarding the outcome of future decisions by the APSC and the FERC, involved
especially subjective judgment and specialized knowledge of accounting for
rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
APSC and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the APSC and the FERC for the
Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly
available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or
of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the APSC’s and the
FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated
the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory
asset and liability balances for completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, including the Opportunity Sales
Proceeding, we inspected the Company’s filings with the APSC and the FERC,
including the annual formula rate plan filing, and considered the filings with
the APSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future
rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, including the Opportunity
Sales Proceeding, to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable
of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

Hurricane Zeta caused significant damage to portions of Entergy Louisiana’s
service area. The storms resulted in widespread outages, significant damage to
distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the
outages. Additionally, as a result of Hurricane Laura’s extensive damage to
the grid infrastructure serving the impacted area, large portions of the
underlying transmission system required nearly a complete rebuild. Total
restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Louisiana’s
electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta are currently estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion, including
approximately $1.67 billion in capital costs and approximately $330 million in
non-capital costs. This estimate includes all costs to restore power and
repair or replace the damages from the hurricanes, except for the cost to
repair or replace damage incurred to an Entergy Louisiana transmission line in
southeast Louisiana, and the amount of that cost could be significant. The
restoration plan for this transmission line and the related cost estimate is
still being evaluated. Also, Entergy Louisiana’s revenues were adversely
affected in 2020, primarily due to power outages resulting from the
hurricanes. Entergy Louisiana is considering all reasonable avenues to recover
storm-related costs from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta,
including securitization. Storm cost recovery or financing will be subject to
review by applicable regulatory authorities.

  

Entergy Louisiana recorded accounts payable and corresponding construction
work in progress and regulatory assets for the estimated costs incurred that
were necessary to return customers to service. Entergy Louisiana recorded the
regulatory assets in accordance with its accounting policies and based on the
historic treatment of such costs in its service area because management
believes that recovery through some form of regulatory mechanism is probable.
There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these
catastrophic events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm
costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because
Entergy Louisiana has not gone through the regulatory process regarding these
storm costs, there is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to predict
with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives,
the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing
of such recovery.

  

In October 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC seeking
approval of certain ratemaking adjustments to facilitate issuance of shorter-
term bonds to provide interim financing for restoration costs associated with
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta. Subsequently, Entergy
Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed a joint motion seeking approval to exclude
from the derivation of Entergy Louisiana’s capital structure and cost rate of
debt for ratemaking purposes, including the allowance for funds used during
construction, shorter-term debt up to $1.1 billion issued by Entergy Louisiana
to fund costs associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane
Zeta costs on an interim basis. In November 2020 the LPSC issued an order
approving the joint motion, and Entergy Louisiana issued $1.1 billion of 0.62%
Series mortgage bonds due November 2023. Also in November 2020, Entergy
Louisiana drew $257 million from its funded storm reserves.

  

In December 2020, Entergy Louisiana provided the LPSC with notification that
it intends to initiate a storm cost recovery proceeding in the near future,
which will permit the LPSC to retain any outside consultants and counsel
needed to review the storm cost recovery application. In February 2021 the
LPSC voted to retain outside counsel and consultants to assist in the review
of Entergy Louisiana’s upcoming storm cost recovery application, which is
expected to be filed in March 2021.

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

See the “February 2021 Winter Storms” section of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion
of the February 2021 winter storms. Entergy Louisiana’s preliminary estimate
for the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring power is approximately $50
million to $60 million. Natural gas purchases for Entergy Louisiana for
February 1st through 25th, 2021 are approximately $190 million compared to
natural gas purchases for February 2020 of $39 million.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income increased $390.8 million primarily due to the $382.8 million
reduction in deferred income tax expense related to the basis of assets
contributed in the 2015 Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
business combination as a result of the resolution of the 2014-2015 IRS audit
in the fourth quarter 2020 and the $58 million reduction in income tax expense
resulting from an IRS settlement in the first quarter 2020 related to the
uncertain tax position regarding the Hurricane Isaac Louisiana Act 55
financing, which also resulted in a $29 million ($21 million net-of-tax)
regulatory charge to reflect Entergy Louisiana’s agreement to share the
savings with customers. Also contributing to the increase were higher retail
electric price, lower other operation and maintenance expenses, and a lower
effective income tax rate. The increase was partially offset by higher
depreciation and amortization expenses, lower volume/weather, lower other
income, higher interest expense, and higher taxes other than income taxes. See
Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the tax audit
resolution and the tax settlement.

  

Operating Revenues

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2020 to
2019:

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $4,285.2 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income |  |  |  |  | |
|(330.3) |  |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | (68.8) |  |  |  | |
|Return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers | 7.5 |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | 176.3 |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | $4,069.9 |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy Louisiana’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to
recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and
expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net
income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net
income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to decreased commercial and
industrial usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta on sales, and the effect
of less favorable weather on residential sales, partially offset by increased
residential usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in
industrial usage is partially offset by an increase in demand from expansion
projects, primarily in the transportation and chemicals industries. See “The
COVID-19 Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the

COVID-19 pandemic. See “Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta”
above for discussion of the storms.

  

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to
customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred
income taxes through changes in the formula rate plan effective May 2018. In
2020, $31.1 million was returned to customers as compared to $38.6 million in
2019. There was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues
was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act.

  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula
rate plan revenues effective June 2019 due to the inclusion of the first-year
revenue requirement for the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St.
Charles Power Station) and effective April 2020 due to the inclusion of the
first-year revenue requirement for the Lake Charles Power Station and
increases in formula rate plan revenues effective September 2019 and September
2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the
formula rate plan proceedings.

  

Other Income Statement Variances

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $10.2 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a
lower scope of work performed in 2020 as compared to 2019, in part as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic;

•a decrease of $9.5 million primarily due to contract costs in 2019 related to
initiatives to explore new customer products and services;

•a decrease of $6.8 million in loss provisions;

•higher nuclear insurance refunds of $5.9 million;

•a decrease of $5.8 million in energy efficiency costs due to the timing of
recovery from customers; and

•a decrease of $4.3 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due
to a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2020 as compared to
the same period in 2019, partially offset by increases resulting from the J.
Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station) and the Lake
Charles Power Station being placed in service.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•an increase of $4.1 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due
to an increase in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs
as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit
liabilities. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the
financial statements for further discussion of pension and other
postretirement benefit costs; and

•several individually insignificant items.

  

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad
valorem taxes resulting from higher property assessments.

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to
plant in service, including the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St.
Charles Power Station), which was placed into service in May 2019 and the Lake
Charles Power Station, which was placed in service in March 2020.

  

Other regulatory charges (credits) include regulatory charges of $32.6 million
recorded in the fourth quarter 2020 due to a settlement with the IRS related
to the uncertain tax position regarding Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita
Louisiana Act 55 financing because the savings will be shared with customers
and $29 million recorded in the first quarter 2020 due to a settlement with
the IRS related to the uncertain tax position regarding Hurricane Isaac
Louisiana Act 55 financing because the savings will be shared with customers.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the
settlements and savings obligations.

Other income decreased primarily due to:

  

•a decrease in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to
higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the J. Wayne Leonard
Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station) and the Lake Charles Power
Station projects; and

•changes in decommissioning trust fund activity.

  

Interest expense increased primarily due to:

  

•the issuances of $300 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds and $350 million
of 2.90% Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2020;

•the issuance of $525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;
and

•a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due
to higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the J. Wayne
Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station) and Lake Charles
Power Station projects.

  

The effective income tax rates were (54.6%) for 2020 and 15% for 2019. The
difference in the effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate
of 21% for 2020 was primarily due to completion of the 2014-2015 IRS audit
effectively settling the tax positions for those years. The difference in the
effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019
was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income
taxes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note
3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory
rates of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $163 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $186.1 million in storm spending in 2020, primarily due to
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration efforts. See
“Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta” above for discussion of
storm restoration efforts;

•lower collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic;

•the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•an increase of $21.5 million in interest paid.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease in $43.7 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages;

•the timing of payments to vendors; and

•income tax refunds of $14.7 million in 2020 compared to $15.3 million in
income tax payments in 2019. Entergy Louisiana had income tax refunds in 2020
and income tax payments in 2019 in accordance with an intercompany tax
allocation agreement. Entergy Louisiana had income tax refunds in 2020 as a
result of a refund of an overpayment on a prior year state income tax return.

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $291 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $709.7 million in storm spending 2020, primarily due to
Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration efforts, See
“Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta” above for discussion of
storm restoration efforts;

•the purchase of Washington Parish Energy Center in November 2020 for
approximately $222 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the Washington Parish Energy Center purchase;

•an increase of $16.7 million in distribution construction expenditures
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy
Louisiana’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced
metering infrastructure; and

•money pool activity.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•an increase of $302.2 million in net receipts from storm reserve escrow
accounts;

•a decrease of $207.8 million in non-nuclear generation construction
expenditures due to higher spending in 2019 on the Lake Charles Power Station
and J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles Power Station)
projects;

•a decrease of $133.1 million in transmission construction expenditures
primarily due to a lower scope of work performed on various projects in 2020
as compared to 2019;

•a decrease of $89.5 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily
due to a lower scope of work performed on various nuclear projects in 2020 as
compared to 2019; and

•a decrease of $26.1 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel
activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of
fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material, and service
deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle.

  

Increases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of
cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by

million in 2019. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement
designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term
borrowings.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $1,221.4 million in
2020 primarily due to:

  

•the issuance of $1.1 billion of 0.62% Series mortgage bonds in November 2020;

•the issuance of $350 million of 2.90% Series mortgage bonds and $300 million
of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2020;

•the issuance of $300 million of 2.90% Series mortgage bonds and $300 million
of 1.60% Series mortgage bonds, each in November 2020; and

•a decrease of $186.5 million in common equity distributions in 2020 primarily
due to upcoming capital expenditures.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•the issuance of $525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;

•the repayment in August 2020 of $250 million of 3.95% Series mortgage bonds
due October 2020;

•the repayment in December 2020 of $200 million of 5.25% Series mortgage bonds
due July 2052;

•money pool activity;

•the repayment in December 2020 of $100 million of 4.70% Series mortgage bonds
due June 2063; and

•net repayments of long-term borrowings of $62 million in 2020 on the nuclear
fuel company variable interest entities’ credit facilities.

  

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash
flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool decreased by $82.8
million in 2020 compared to increasing by $82.8 million in 2019.

Capital Structure

  

Entergy Louisiana’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The
increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Louisiana is primarily due
to the net issuances of long-term debt in 2020.

(a)Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to
Entergy Louisiana.

  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of
short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt,
including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common
equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.
Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization
bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful
information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s
financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to
Entergy Louisiana, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial
statements. Entergy Louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio
excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and
believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in
evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition because net debt indicates
Entergy Louisiana’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily
satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

  

Entergy Louisiana seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with
its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital
structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support
planned investments, Entergy Louisiana may issue incremental debt or reduce
distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in
certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that
would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt
and reducing distributions, Entergy Louisiana may receive equity contributions
to maintain its capital structure.

  

Uses of Capital

  

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
costs; and

•distribution and interest payments.

  

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and
other capital investments.

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5
to the financial statements.

(b)Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or
cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.
For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel
and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia
purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which
are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana
currently expects to contribute approximately $59.9 million to its qualified
pension plans and approximately $15.6 million to its other postretirement
health care and life insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required
pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1,
2021 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See
“Critical Accounting Estimates \- Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement
benefits funding.

  

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned
capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana includes specific
investments such as transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce
congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to maintain
reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced meters and

Hurricane Isaac

  

In June 2014 the LPSC voted to approve a series of orders which (i) quantified
$290.8 million of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs as prudently
incurred; (ii) determined $290 million as the level of storm reserves to be
re-established; (iii) authorized Entergy Louisiana to utilize Louisiana Act 55
financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs; and (iv) granted other
requested relief associated with storm reserves and Act 55 financing of
Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs. Entergy Louisiana committed to pass
on to customers a minimum of $30.8 million of customer benefits through annual
customer credits of approximately $6.2 million for five years. Approvals for
the Act 55 financings were obtained from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration
Corporation and the Louisiana State Bond Commission. See Note 2 to the
financial statements for a discussion of the August 2014 issuance of bonds
under Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature.

  

Little Gypsy Repowering Project

  

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the
solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant. In March
2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana

346

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of
the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether
to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors
including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental
concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the
capital/financial markets. In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the
LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended
period of time of three years or more. In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order
declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project
into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest
and prudent.

  

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking
permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project
cost recovery over a five-year period. In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC
staff and intervenors filed testimony. The LPSC staff (1) agreed that it was
prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that
the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not
imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related
costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery
from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to consider 15
years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on
project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while
also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5)
indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project
costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. In the third quarter
2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined
that it was probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project would be
abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from
construction work in progress to a regulatory asset. A hearing on the issues,
except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in
November 2010. In January 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the
disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including
cost recovery and cost allocation. The settlement provides for Entergy
Louisiana to recover $200 million as of March 31, 2011, and carrying costs on
that amount on specified terms thereafter. The settlement also provides for
Entergy Louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. In
April 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to authorize
the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the
project and to issue a financing order by which Entergy Louisiana could
accomplish such securitization. In August 2011 the LPSC issued an order
approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the
securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
September 2011 issuance of the securitization bonds.

  

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

  

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly
influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are
determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is
primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In June 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report
for its 2017 calendar year operations. The 2017 test year evaluation report
produced an earned return on equity of 8.16%, due in large part to revenue-
neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms. Without these realignments,
the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of 9.88% and a
resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of $4.8 million.
Excluding the Tax Act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment
mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total
of $98 million as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the
additional capacity and MISO cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate
plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism. In August
2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan

evaluation report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan
proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect
lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses
to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement. Based on the August 2018
update, Entergy Louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan
revenue of approximately $17.6 million. Results of the updated 2017 evaluation
report filing were implemented with the September 2018 billing month subject
to refund and review by the LPSC staff and intervenors. In accordance with the
terms of the formula rate plan, in September 2018 the LPSC staff and
intervenors submitted their responses to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula
rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates. The LPSC
staff asserted objections/reservations regarding 1) Entergy Louisiana’s
proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated
deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Act and the treatment of accumulated
deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base; 2) Entergy
Louisiana’s reservation regarding treatment of a regulatory asset related to
certain special orders by the LPSC; and 3) test year expenses billed from
Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana. Intervenors also objected to Entergy
Louisiana’s treatment of the regulatory asset related to certain special
orders by the LPSC. A procedural schedule has not yet been established to
resolve these issues.

  

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial
proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be
accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of
other customer classes.

  

Commercial operation at J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (formerly St. Charles
Power Station) commenced in May 2019. In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed an
update to its 2017 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the
estimated first-year revenue requirement of $109.5 million associated with the
J. Wayne Leonard Power Station. The resulting interim adjustment to rates
became effective with the first billing cycle of June 2019. In June 2020,
Entergy Louisiana submitted information to the LPSC to review the prudence of
Entergy Louisiana’s management of the project. In August 2020 discovery
commenced and a procedural schedule was established with a hearing in July
2021.

  

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report
for its 2018 calendar year operations. The 2018 test year evaluation report
produced an earned return on common equity of 10.61% leading to a base rider
formula rate plan revenue decrease of $8.9 million. While base rider formula
rate plan revenue will decrease as a result of this filing, overall formula
rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $118.7 million. This outcome
is primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through
the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission
recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity
mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items. The filing is
subject to review by the LPSC. Resulting rates were implemented in September
2019, subject to refund.

  

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial
proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be
accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of
other customer classes. Entergy Louisiana contemplates that any combination of
residential rates resulting from this request would be implemented with the
results of the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing.

  

Several parties intervened in the proceeding and the LPSC staff filed its
report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the formula rate plan. In its report the LPSC staff re-urged reservations
with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate
plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test
years 2017 and 2018. The LPSC staff objected to Entergy Louisiana’s proposal
to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference
to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue. The LPSC
staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of Willow
Glen reflected in the evaluation report and to the August 2019 compliance
update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in
the formula rate plan’s transmission recovery mechanism,

based on limited time to review it. Additionally, since the completion of
certain transmission projects, the LPSC staff issued supplemental data
requests addressing the prudence of Entergy Louisiana’s expenditures in
connection with those projects. Entergy Louisiana has responded to all such
requests.

  

Commercial operation at Lake Charles Power Station commenced in March 2020. In
March 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2018 formula rate plan
evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of
$108 million associated with the Lake Charles Power Station. The resulting
interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of
April 2020.

  

In an effort to narrow the remaining issues in formula rate plan test years
2017 and 2018, Entergy Louisiana provided notice to the parties in October
2020 that it was withdrawing its request to combine residential rates. Entergy
Louisiana noted that the withdrawal is without prejudice to Entergy
Louisiana’s right to seek to combine residential rates in a future proceeding.

  

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

In May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its formula rate plan
evaluation report for its 2019 calendar year operations. The 2019 test year
evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 9.66%. As
such, no change to base rider formula rate plan revenue is required. Although
base rider formula rate plan revenue will not change as a result of this
filing, overall formula rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $103
million. This outcome is driven by the removal of prior year credits
associated with the sale of the Willow Glen Power Station and an increase in
the transmission recovery mechanism. Also contributing to the overall change
is an increase in legacy formula rate plan revenue requirements driven by
legacy Entergy Louisiana capacity cost true-ups and higher annualized legacy
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana revenues due to higher billing determinants,
offset by reductions in MISO cost recovery mechanism and tax reform adjustment
mechanism revenue requirements. In August 2020 the LPSC staff submitted a list
of items for which it needs additional information to confirm the accuracy and
compliance of the 2019 test year evaluation report. The LPSC staff objected to
a proposed revenue neutral adjustment regarding a certain rider as being
beyond the scope of permitted formula rate plan adjustments. Rates reflected
in the May 2020 filing, with the exception of the revenue neutral rider
adjustment, and as updated in an August 2020 filing, were implemented in
September 2020, subject to refund. Entergy Louisiana is in the process of
providing additional information and details on the May 2020 filing as
requested by the LPSC staff.

  

In November 2020, Entergy Louisiana accepted ownership of the Washington
Parish Energy Center and filed an update to its 2019 formula rate plan
evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of
$35 million associated with the Washington Parish Energy Center. The resulting
interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of
December 2020. In January 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2019
formula rate plan evaluation report to include the implementation of a
scheduled step-up in its nuclear decommissioning revenue requirement and a
true-up for under-collections of nuclear decommissioning expenses. The total
rate adjustment would increase formula rate plan revenues by approximately
$1.2 million. The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with
the first billing cycle of February 2021.

  

Request for Extension and Modification of Formula Rate Plan

  

In May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its application for
authority to extend its formula rate plan. In its application, Entergy
Louisiana seeks to maintain a 9.8% return on equity, with a bandwidth of 60
basis points above and below the midpoint, with a first-year midpoint reset.
Entergy Louisiana also seeks to maintain its existing additional capacity
mechanism, tax reform adjustment mechanism, transmission recovery mechanism,
and the MISO cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Louisiana also seeks to add a
distribution cost recovery mechanism which operates in substantially the same
manner as the transmission recovery mechanism, seeks to utilize end of period
rate base to calculate cost of service, and requests a deferral of certain
expenses incurred for outside of right-of-way vegetation programs. Settlement
discussions are ongoing.

Investigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services

  

In November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an
investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the
retail rates of Entergy Louisiana. As stated in the notice of proceeding, the
LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by
Entergy Services. Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly
detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the
audit. There has been no further activity in the investigation since May 2019.

  

Fuel and purchased power recovery

  

Entergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the
billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to
the billing month. Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include
estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises
from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues
billed to customers, including carrying charges.

  

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of the fuel
adjustment clause filings by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, whose business was
combined with Entergy Louisiana in 2015. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel
adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. In January 2019, the
LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff
consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $900,000,
plus interest, to customers based upon the imputation of a claim of vendor
fault in servicing its nuclear plant. Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision
in first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit. In August 2019,
Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the LPSC
staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation of
replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is
appropriate. Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require no refund to
customers.

  

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Louisiana through its fuel
adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013. In January 2019 the
LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff
consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $7.3
million, plus interest, to customers based upon the imputation of a claim of
vendor fault in servicing its nuclear plant. Entergy Louisiana recorded a
provision in the first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit. In
August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis
for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative
calculation of replacement power costs should it be determined that a
disallowance is appropriate. Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require a
refund to customers of approximately $4.3 million, plus interest, as compared
to the LPSC staff’s recommendation of $7.3 million, plus interest. Responsive
testimony was filed by the LPSC staff and intervenors in September 2019; all
parties either agreed with or did not oppose Entergy Louisiana’s alternative
calculation of replacement power costs.

  

In November 2019 the pending LPSC proceedings for the 2010-2013 Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana audits were consolidated to
facilitate a settlement of both fuel audits. In December 2019 an unopposed
settlement was reached that requires a refund to legacy Entergy Louisiana
customers of approximately $2.3 million, including interest, and no refund to
legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers. The LPSC approved the
settlement in January 2020. A one-time refund was made in February 2020.

  

In June 2016 the LPSC issued notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel
adjustment clause filings for the period 2014 through 2015 and purchased gas
adjustment clause filings for the period 2012 through 2015. In recognition of
the business combination that occurred in 2015, the audit notice was issued to
Entergy Louisiana and also includes a review of charges to legacy Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana customers prior to the business combination. The audits
include a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2014 through 2015 and
charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s

purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2012 through 2015.
Regarding the fuel adjustment clause filing, the LPSC staff issued a report in
January 2021 that did not recommend a disallowance for the period 2014 through
2015 recoveries, but did propose various reporting requirements. Entergy
Louisiana is currently reviewing the LPSC staff recommendations regarding
reporting requirements. Regarding the purchased gas adjustment clause filings,
the LPSC staff issued a report in February 2020 that did not recommend a
disallowance for the period 2012 through 2015 recoveries. The LPSC issued an
order in September 2020 accepting the LPSC staff’s report.

  

In May 2018 the LPSC staff provided notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s
purchased gas adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas
adjustment clause for the period from 2016 through 2017. In February 2020 the
LPSC staff issued an audit report recommending a disallowance of approximately
$29 thousand Entergy Louisiana submitted a letter disputing the basis of the
proposed disallowance but indicated that due to the amount at issue it would
not oppose the recommended refund. The LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana
submitted a joint report noting each party’s position on the substantive
issues in the matter and recommending resolution of the matters. The LPSC
issued an order in September 2020 resolving the matter and ordering a refund
of approximately $29 thousand. In January 2021 the LPSC issued a notice
closing the matter.

  

In March 2020 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy
Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the
reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment
clause for the period from 2016 through 2019. Discovery commenced in September
2020 and is ongoing.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In April 2020 the LPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to record as a
regulatory asset expenses incurred from the suspension of disconnections and
collection of late fees imposed by LPSC orders associated with the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, utilities may seek future recovery, subject to LPSC
review and approval, of losses and expenses incurred due to compliance with
the LPSC’s COVID-19 orders. The suspension of late fees and disconnects for
non-pay was extended until the first billing cycle after July 16, 2020. In
January 2021, Entergy Louisiana resumed disconnections for customers in all
customer classes with past-due balances that have not made payment
arrangements. Utilities seeking to recover the regulatory asset must formally
petition the LPSC to do so, identifying the direct and indirect costs for
which recovery is sought. Any such request is subject to LPSC review and
approval. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Louisiana recorded a regulatory
asset of $48.8 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Net Metering Rulemaking

  

In September 2019 the LPSC issued an order modifying its rules regarding net
metering installations. Among other things, the rule provides for 2-channel
billing for net metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated
at the utility’s avoided cost. However, the rule does provide that net meter
installations in place as of December 31, 2019 will be subject to 1:1 net
metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated at the full
retail rate for a period of 15 years (through December 31, 2034), after which
those installations will be subject to 2-channel billing. The rule also
eliminates the existing limit on the cumulative number of net meter
installations.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

  

Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually
explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an
option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base.
Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers
and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that
match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively
participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation
activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and
existing customers.

  

Federal Regulation

section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial
Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a
discussion of federal regulation.

  

Nuclear Matters

  

Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend and
Waterford 3 nuclear power plants. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to
the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks
related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-
level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for
capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet
to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these
nuclear plants; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory
changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant
ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the
availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear
fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the
sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to
complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the
amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection
with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear
accident. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend or
Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or
credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.
Waterford 3’s operating license expires in 2044 and River Bend’s operating
license expires in 2045.

  

Environmental Risks

  

Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by
various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water
quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce
estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy
Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations.

for nuclear decommissioning costs.

  

In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its
estimated decommissioning cost liability for Waterford 3 as a result of a
revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $147.5
million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a
corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be
depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit.

Entergy Louisiana’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs,
as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous
factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics,
and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.
See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical
Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s
estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the member and Board of Directors of

Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy
Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows, and changes in equity (pages 357 through 362 and applicable items
in pages 51 through 238), for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries — Refer
to Note 2 to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Louisiana Public Service
Commission (the “LPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of
electric companies in Louisiana, and to wholesale rate regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it
meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying

355

the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate
regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple
financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and
equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes; operating
revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization
expense.

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the LPSC and the FERC set the rates the
Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a
reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that
require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation,
including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company
assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to
meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance
sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes
consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for
similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and
political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover
costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the LPSC
and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing
utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility
business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery
in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing
management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the LPSC
and the FERC, involved especially subjective judgment and specialized
knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
LPSC and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the LPSC and the FERC for the
Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly
available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or
of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the LPSC’s and the
FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated
the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory
asset and liability balances for completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with
the LPSC and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filing, and
considered the filings with the LPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may
impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict
management’s assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s
assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in
rates.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, LLC

  

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

The COVID-19 Pandemic

  

See “The COVID-19” Pandemic section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

See the “February 2021 Winter Storms” section of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion
of the February 2021 winter storms. Entergy Mississippi’s preliminary estimate
for the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring power is approximately $50
million to $60 million. Natural gas purchases for Entergy Mississippi for
February 1st through 25th, 2021 are approximately $45 million compared to
natural gas purchases for February 2020 of $14 million.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income increased $20.7 million primarily due to higher retail electric
price, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses,
higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and lower volume/weather.

  

Operating Revenues

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2020 to
2019.

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $1,323.0 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income |  |  |  |  | |
|(153.2) |  |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | (17.6) |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | 95.7 |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | 1,247.9 |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy Mississippi’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed
to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and
expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net
income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net
income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to decreased commercial and
industrial usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of less
favorable weather on residential sales, partially offset by increased
residential usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “The COVID-19
Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table of Contents

Entergy Mississippi, LLC

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to:

  

•increases in the formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing
cycles of July 2019 and April 2020 and an interim capacity rate adjustment to
the formula rate plan effective January 2020 to recover non-fuel related costs
of acquiring and operating the Choctaw Generating Station; and

•the implementation of a vegetation management rider effective with the April
2020 billing cycle.

  

See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula
rate plan filings and the vegetation management rider.

  

Other Income Statement Variances

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $13.5 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due
to an increase in costs after the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station
in October 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $11.1 million primarily due
to a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2020 as compared to
the same period in 2019, including a delay in plant outages as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic;

•an increase of $8.1 million in storm damage provisions. See Note 2 to the
financial statements for a discussion of storm cost recovery;

•an increase of $4.7 million in distribution operations costs due to a higher
scope of work, including contract costs in 2020 as compared to the same period
in 2019;

•an increase of $2.5 million in energy efficiency costs due to the timing of
recovery from customers; and

•several individually insignificant items.

  

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3.7 million primarily due
to contract costs in 2019 related to initiatives to explore new customer
products and services.

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of
higher depreciation rates effective July 2019, as approved by the MPSC, and
additions to plant in service, including the Choctaw Generating Station, which
was purchased in October 2019.

  

The effective income tax rates were 16.2% for 2020 and 20.5% for 2019. See
Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal
statutory rates of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Results of Operations”
in Item 7 of Entergy Mississippi’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2020, for
discussion of results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $39.6 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power;

•lower collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic; and

•an increase of $10.3 million in storm spending in 2020.

  

The decrease was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors and a
decrease of $8.2 million in pension contributions in 2020. See “Critical
Accounting Estimates” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a
discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $202.9 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station in October 2019 for
approximately $305 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the Choctaw Generating Station purchase; and

•money pool activity.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•an increase of $47.3 million in storm spending in 2020;

•an increase of $40.9 million in distribution construction expenditures
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy
Mississippi’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced
metering infrastructure;

•an increase of $25.8 million in non-nuclear construction expenditures
primarily due to increased expenditures after the purchase of the Choctaw
Generating Station in October 2019 and higher long-term service agreement
expenses;

•$24.6 million in plant upgrades for Choctaw Generating Station in March 2020;
and

Entergy Mississippi, LLC

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•an increase of $22.4 million in transmission construction expenditures
primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2020 as compared to 2019.

  

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source
of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool
decreased by $44.7 million in 2020 compared to increasing by $3.3 million in
2019. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to
reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $229.5 million in
2020 primarily due to:

  

•the issuance of $170 million of 3.5% Series mortgage bonds in 2020 compared
to the issuance of $435 million of 3.85% Series mortgage bonds in 2019; and

•a capital contribution of $130 million in October 2019 in anticipation of the
purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station.

  

The decrease was partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $150
million of 6.64% Series mortgage bonds in July 2019 and money pool activity.

  

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a source of
cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool increased $16.5
million in 2020.

  

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital
Resources \- Cash Flow” in Item 7 of Entergy Mississippi’s Annual Report on

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Entergy Mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with
its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital
structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support
planned investments, Entergy Mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce
distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in
certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that
would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt
and reducing distributions, Entergy Mississippi may receive equity
contributions to maintain its capital structure.

  

Uses of Capital

  

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
costs; and

•distributions and interest payments.

  

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and

statements.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi
currently expects to contribute approximately $13.7 million to its qualified
pension plans and approximately $130 thousand to other postretirement health
care and life insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required pension
contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2021
valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See

benefits funding.

  

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $84
million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes
for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably
estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax
positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information
regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

  

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned
capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi includes amounts
associated with specific investments such as the Sunflower Solar Facility;
transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable
economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve
service to customers, including advanced meters and related investments;
resource planning, including potential generation and renewables projects;
system improvements; software and security; and other investments. Estimated
capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may
vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements,
environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic
trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to
access capital.

  

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy
Mississippi pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined
monthly.

  

Sunflower Solar Facility

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi announced that it signed an agreement
for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW solar photovoltaic facility that
will be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi.
The estimated base purchase price is approximately $138.4 million. The
estimated total investment, including the base purchase price and other
related costs, for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Sunflower Solar Facility
is approximately $153.2 million. The purchase is contingent upon, among other
things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from
applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. The project
is being built by Sunflower County Solar Project, LLC, an indirect subsidiary
of Recurrent Energy, LLC. Entergy Mississippi will purchase the facility upon
mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been
met. In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed a joint petition with
Sunflower Solar Project with the MPSC for Sunflower Solar Project to construct
and for Entergy Mississippi to acquire and thereafter own, operate, improve,
and maintain the solar facility. Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its
formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism, the interim capacity
rate adjustment mechanism, in the formula rate plan to recover the non-fuel
related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi,
including the annual ownership costs of the Sunflower Solar Facility. In
December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to
its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment
mechanism. Recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment requires MPSC
approval for each new resource. In August 2019 consultants retained by the
Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed a report expressing concerns
regarding the project economics. In March 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed
supplemental testimony addressing questions and observations raised by the
consultants retained by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and proposing
an alternative structure for the transaction that would reduce its cost. A
hearing before the MPSC was held in March 2020. In April 2020 the MPSC issued
an order approving certification of the Sunflower Solar Facility and its
recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, subject to
certain conditions including: (i) that Entergy Mississippi pursue a
partnership structure through which the partnership would acquire and own the
facility under the build-own-transfer agreement and (ii) that if Entergy
Mississippi does not consummate the partnership structure under the terms of
the order, there will be a cap of $136 million on the level of recoverable
costs. Closing is targeted to occur by the end of 2021.

Formula Rate Plan Filings

  

In October 2018, Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate
plan that would provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim
capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of
additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the non-
fuel annual ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating Station, as well as to
allow similar cost recovery treatment for other future capacity acquisitions,
such as the Sunflower Solar Facility, that are approved by the MPSC. In
December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to
its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment
mechanism to recover the $59 million first-year annual revenue requirement
associated with the non-fuel ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating
Station, which Entergy Mississippi began billing in January 2020. The MPSC
must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each
new resource. In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate
plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments
effective April 1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or
credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order. The MPSC also authorized
Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula
rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation
management rider. Effective with the April 2020 billing cycle, Entergy
Mississippi implemented a rider to recover $22 million in vegetation
management costs.

  

In March 2019, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2019 test
year filing and 2018 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return for the historical 2018 calendar year to be above the formula rate plan
bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2019 calendar year to be below
the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2019 test year filing shows a $36.8
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.94% return
on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2018 look-back
filing compares actual 2018 results to the approved benchmark return on rate
base and shows a $10.1 million interim decrease in formula rate plan revenues
is necessary. In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Mississippi recorded a
provision of $9.3 million that reflected the estimate of the difference
between the 2018 expected earned rate of return on rate base and an
established performance-adjusted benchmark rate of return under the formula
rate plan performance-adjusted bandwidth mechanism. In the first quarter 2019,
Entergy Mississippi recorded a $0.8 million increase in the provision to
reflect the amount shown in the look-back filing. In June 2019, Entergy
Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint
stipulation that confirmed that the 2019 test year filing showed that a $32.8
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.93% return
on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. Additionally, pursuant
to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 look-back filing
reflected an earned return on rate base of 7.81% in calendar year 2018 which
is above the look-back benchmark return on rate base of 7.13%, resulting in an
$11 million decrease in formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through
May 2020. In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Mississippi recorded an
additional $0.9 million increase in the provision to reflect the $11 million
shown in the look-back filing. In June 2019 the MPSC approved the joint
stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2019.

  

In March 2020, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2020 test
year filing and 2019 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return for the historical 2019 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan
bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2020 calendar year to be below
the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2020 test year filing shows a $24.6
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.51% return
on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2019 look-back
filing compares actual 2019 results to the approved benchmark return on rate
base and reflects the need for a $7.3 million interim increase in formula rate
plan revenues. In accordance with the MPSC-approved revisions to the formula
rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $24.3 million interim rate
increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2019 retail revenues, effective with
the April 2020 billing cycle, subject to refund. In June 2020, Entergy
Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint
stipulation that confirmed that the 2020 test year filing showed that a $23.8
million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned
return on common equity to the specified point of

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

adjustment of 6.51% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan
bandwidth. Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2019 look-
back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.75% in calendar year
2019, which is within the look-back bandwidth. As a result, there is no change
in formula rate plan revenues in the 2019 look-back filing. In June 2020 the
MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective for the first billing
cycle of July 2020. In the June 2020 order the MPSC directed Entergy
Mississippi to submit revisions to its formula rate plan to realign recovery
of costs from its energy efficiency cost recovery rider to its formula rate
plan. In November 2020 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s revisions to
its formula rate plan providing for the realignment of energy efficiency costs
to its formula rate plan, the deferral of energy efficiency expenditures into
a regulatory asset, and the elimination of its energy efficiency cost recovery
rider effective with the January 2022 billing cycle.

  

COVID-19 Order

  

In March 2020 the MPSC issued an order suspending disconnections for a period
of sixty days. The MPSC extended the order on disconnections through May 26,
2020. In April 2020 the MPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to defer
incremental costs and expenses associated with COVID-19 compliance and to seek
future recovery through rates of the prudently incurred incremental costs and
expenses. In December 2020, Entergy Mississippi resumed disconnections for
commercial, industrial, and governmental customers with past-due balances that
have not made payment arrangements. In January 2021, Entergy Mississippi
resumed disconnecting service for residential customers with past-due balances
that have not made arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Mississippi
recorded a regulatory asset of $19.2 million for costs associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Internal Restructuring

  

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC seeking
authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer
of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Mississippi to a
new entity, which would ultimately be held by an existing Entergy subsidiary
holding company. In September 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi
Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed a joint stipulation regarding
the restructuring filing. In September 2018 the MPSC issued an order accepting
the stipulation in its entirety and approving the restructuring and credits of
$27 million to retail customers over six years, consisting of annual payments
of $4.5 million for the years 2019-2024. Entergy Mississippi also received the
required FERC approval.

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi undertook a multi-step restructuring,
including the following:

  

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock, at the
aggregate redemption price of approximately $21.2 million.

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. converted from a Mississippi corporation to a Texas
corporation.

•Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Mississippi,
Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light), and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light assumed
substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Mississippi, Inc., in a
transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Mississippi, Inc.
remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi
Power and Light.

•Entergy Mississippi, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy
Mississippi Power and Light to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company,
LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).
As a result of the contribution, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

  

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi, Inc. changed its name to Entergy
Utility Enterprises, Inc., and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light then
changed its name to Entergy Mississippi, LLC. Entergy Mississippi, LLC holds
substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the
liabilities, of Entergy Mississippi, Inc. The restructuring was accounted for
as a transaction between entities under common control.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its notice of intent to implement
the restructuring credit rider to allow Entergy Mississippi to return credits
of $27 million to retail customers over six years. In January 2019 the MPSC
approved the proposed restructuring credit adjustment factor, which is
effective for bills rendered beginning February 2019.

  

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

  

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider
that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries.
Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits
conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

  

In January 2017 the MPSC certified to the Mississippi Legislature the audit
reports of its independent auditors for the fuel year ending September 30,
2016. In November 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff separately
engaged a consultant to review the September 2016 outage at the Grand Gulf
Nuclear Station and to review ongoing operations at Grand Gulf. This
engagement continues, and subsequently, was expanded to include all outages at
Grand Gulf that occurred through 2019.

  

In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately
$61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills.

  

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately
$57 million as of September 30, 2018. In January 2019 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2019 bills.

  

In November 2019, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation included $39.6 million of prior over-recovery flowing back to
customers beginning September 2020. Entergy Mississippi’s balance in its
deferred fuel account did not decrease as expected after implementation of the
new factor. In an effort to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, in
May 2020, Entergy Mississippi requested an interim adjustment to the energy
cost recovery rider to credit approximately $50 million from the over-
recovered balance in the deferred fuel account to customers over four
consecutive billing months. The MPSC approved this interim adjustment in May
2020 effective for June through September 2020 bills.

  

In November 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the
annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The
calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of approximately
$24.4 million as of September 30, 2020. In January 2021 the MPSC approved the
proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2021 bills.

  

Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators

  

Entergy Mississippi has approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage
provision of $1.75 million per month. If Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated
storm damage provision balance exceeds $15 million, the collection of the
storm damage provision ceases until such time that the accumulated storm
damage provision becomes less than $10 million. Entergy Mississippi’s storm
damage provision balance has been less than $10 million since May 2019, and
Entergy Mississippi has been billing the monthly storm damage provision since
July 2019.

Environmental Risks

  

Entergy Mississippi’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by
various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water
quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Mississippi is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the member and Board of Directors of

Entergy Mississippi, LLC

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Entergy Mississippi, LLC
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of
income, cash flows and changes in member’s equity (pages 379 through 384 and
applicable items in pages 51 through 238), for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —Entergy Mississippi, LLC — Refer to Note 2 to the
financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service
Commission (the “MPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of
electric companies in Mississippi, and to wholesale rate regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it
meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the
specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.
Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial
statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment;

377

regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes; operating revenues; operation
and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization expense.

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the MPSC and the FERC set the rates the
Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a
reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that
require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation,
including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company
assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to
meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance
sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes
consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for
similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and
political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover
costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the MPSC
and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing
utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility
business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery
in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing
management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the MPSC
and the FERC, involved especially subjective judgment and specialized
knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
MPSC and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the MPSC and the FERC for the
Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly
available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or
of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the MPSC’s and FERC’s
treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the
external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with
the MPSC and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filing, and
considered the filings with the MPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may
impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict
management’s assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s
assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in
rates.

ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

  

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

The COVID-19 Pandemic

  

See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Hurricane Zeta

  

In October 2020, Hurricane Zeta caused significant damage to Entergy New
Orleans’s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages,
significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the
loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair
and/or replacement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric facilities damaged by
Hurricane Zeta are currently estimated to be approximately $40 million,
including approximately $30 million in capital costs and approximately $10
million in non-capital costs. Entergy New Orleans is considering all available
avenues to recover storm-related costs from Hurricane Zeta, including
accessing funded storm reserve escrows and securitization. Storm cost recovery
or financing will be subject to review by applicable regulatory authorities.

  

Entergy New Orleans recorded accounts payable and corresponding construction
work in progress and regulatory assets for the estimated costs incurred that
were necessary to return customers to service. Entergy New Orleans recorded
the regulatory assets in accordance with its accounting policies and based on
the historic treatment of such costs in its service area because management
believes that recovery through some form of regulatory mechanism is probable.
There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these
catastrophic events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm
costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because
Entergy New Orleans has not gone through the regulatory process regarding
these storm costs, there is an element of risk, and Entergy New Orleans is
unable to predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its
recovery initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately
recover, or the timing of such recovery.

  

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

See the “February 2021 Winter Storms” section of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion
of the February 2021 winter storms. Entergy New Orleans’s preliminary estimate
for the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring power is approximately $1
million. Natural gas purchases for Entergy New Orleans for February 1st
through 25th, 2021 are approximately $15 million compared to natural gas
purchases for February 2020 of $7 million.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income decreased $3.3 million primarily due to lower volume/weather, lower
retail electric price, and higher interest expense, partially offset by a
lower effective income tax rate.

Operating Revenues

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2020 to
2019.

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $686.2 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income |  |  |  |  | |
|(32.5) |  |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | (12.5) |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | (7.4) |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | $633.8 |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy New Orleans’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed
to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and
expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net
income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net
income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 374 GWh, or
6.4%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of decreased
commercial and governmental usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales,
partially offset by an increase in residential usage as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation
and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the effects of a rate
reduction implemented with April 2020 bills that was effective August 2019 in
accordance with the City Council resolution and related agreement in principle
reached in the 2018 base rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the rate case.

  

Other Income Statement Variances

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $4.9 million primarily due to the 2019 deferral of costs
related to the 2018 rate case and a system conversion for Algiers customers as
a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution approved by the City
Council. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the
rate case resolution; and

•an increase of $3.8 million in energy efficiency costs.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease of $2.4 million in gas operations costs primarily due to the
deferral in 2020 of certain gas infrastructure replacement program costs as a
result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution. See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution; and

•a decrease of $2.2 million primarily due to contract costs in 2019 related to
initiatives to explore new customer products and services.

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to
plant in service.

Other regulatory charges - net include regulatory credits recorded in the
first quarter 2020 to reflect compliance with terms of the 2018 combined rate
case resolution approved by the City Council in February 2020. See Note 2 to
the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution.

  

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of:

  

•a $70 million term loan at 3.0% in December 2019;

•$78 million of 3.00% Series mortgage bonds in March 2020; and

•$62 million of 3.75% Series mortgage bonds in March 2020.

  

The effective income tax rates were (9.3%) for 2020 and 0.4% for 2019. The
difference in the effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate
of 21% for 2020 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated
deferred income taxes and the completion of the 2014-2015 IRS audit
effectively settling the tax positions for those years. The difference in the
effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019
was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income
taxes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note
3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory
rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Results of Operations”
in Item 7 of Entergy New Orleans’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $51.6 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•lower collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic;

•the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs; and

388

Table of Contents

Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

•income tax payments of $3.4 million made in 2020 compared to income tax
refunds of $5.3 million received in 2019, each in accordance with an
intercompany income tax allocation agreement. The income tax refunds resulted
from the utilization of Entergy New Orleans’s net operating loss.

  

The decrease was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors.

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $16.5 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $12.4 million in distribution construction expenditures
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy
New Orleans’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced
metering infrastructure;

•money pool activity;

•an increase of $10.8 million in storm spending in 2020, primarily due to
Hurricane Zeta restoration efforts. See “Hurricane Zeta” above for discussion
of hurricane restoration efforts; and

•an increase of $5.1 million in facilities construction expenditures primarily
due to a higher scope of work performed in 2020.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•a decrease of $16.2 million in non-nuclear generation construction
expenditures primarily due to lower spending in 2020 on the New Orleans Power
Station project, partially offset by higher spending in 2020 on the New
Orleans Solar Station project; and

•a decrease of $7.5 million in transmission construction expenditures
primarily due to lower spending in 2020 on the New Orleans Power Station
project.

  

Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source
of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool
decreased $5.2 million in 2020 compared to decreasing $16.8 million in 2019.
The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce
the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $75.8 million
primarily due to a capital contribution received from Entergy Corporation of
$60 million in November 2020 in order to maintain Entergy New Orleans’s
capital structure and money pool activity.

  

Increases in Entergy New Orleans’s payable to the money pool are a source of
cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s payable to the money pool increased $10.2
million in 2020.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital

activities for 2019 compared to 2018.

Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Capital Structure

  

Entergy New Orleans’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.
The decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to an increase in
equity resulting from a $60 million capital contribution received from Entergy
Corporation in 2020 and net income, partially offset by the net issuance of
long-term debt in 2020.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|2020 |  | December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
2019  
Debt to capital | 51.5 | % |  | 53.1 | %
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Effect of excluding securitization bonds | (1.6 | %) |  | (2.4 | %)
Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 49.9 | % |  | 50.7 | %
Effect of subtracting cash | — | % |  | (0.3 | %)
Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (a) | 49.9 | % |  | 50.4 | %
  
  

(a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to
Entergy New Orleans.

  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of
short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, long-term debt, including
the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable due to an associated
company. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital
less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital
ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and
believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in
evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because the
securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans, as more fully
described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy New Orleans also uses
the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing
its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its
investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial
condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans’s outstanding debt
position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on
hand.

  

Entergy New Orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with
its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital
structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support
planned investments, Entergy New Orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce
distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in
certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that
would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt
and reducing distributions, Entergy New Orleans may receive equity
contributions to maintain its capital structure.

  

Uses of Capital

  

Entergy New Orleans requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
costs;

•debt maturities or retirements; and

•distribution and interest payments.

also expects to pay for $25 million of capital investments in 2021 related to
Hurricane Zeta restoration work that have been accrued as of December 31,
2020.

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5
to the financial statements.

(b)Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or
cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.
For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional
fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial
statements.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy New Orleans
currently expects to contribute approximately $5.4 million to its qualified
pension plan and approximately $175 thousand to other postretirement health
care and life insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required pension
contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2021
valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See “Critical
Accounting Estimates \- Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits”
below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
funding.

  

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has
$187.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax
attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months
cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective
settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

  

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned
capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans includes transmission
projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic
growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to
customers, including advanced meters and related investments; resource
planning, including potential generation and renewables projects; system
improvements; software and security; and other investments. Estimated capital
expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary
based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements,
environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic
trends, business restructuring,

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy
New Orleans pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined
monthly.

  

Gas Infrastructure Rebuild Plan

  

In September 2016, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council a request
for authorization for Entergy New Orleans to proceed with annual incremental
capital funding of $12.5 million for its gas infrastructure rebuild plan,
which would replace all of Entergy New Orleans’s low pressure cast iron,
steel, and vintage plastic pipe over a ten-year period commencing in 2017.
Entergy New Orleans also proposed that recovery of the investment to fund its
gas infrastructure replacement plan be determined in connection with its next
base rate case. The City Council authorized Entergy New Orleans to proceed
with its replacement plans and established a schedule for proceedings in
advance of the rate case intended to provide an opportunity for evaluation of
the gas infrastructure plan that would best serve the public interest and the
effect on customers of the approval of any such plan. In the course of that
proceeding, the City Council’s advisors submitted pre-filed testimony
recommending that Entergy New Orleans be allowed to continue with its
condition-based approach to gas pipeline replacement to replace approximately
238 miles of low pressure pipe at a rate of approximately 25 miles per year.
The City Council’s advisors also recommended that Entergy New Orleans be
required to adhere to certain reporting requirements and recognized the need
to address the sustained level of investment in gas infrastructure on customer
bills. In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans filed rebuttal testimony
suggesting that its recovery of future investment and customer effects would
be addressed in the rate case that Entergy New Orleans was required to file in
July 2018. The procedural schedule was suspended in order to allow for
resolution in the rate case proceeding. As a result of the rate case, the City
Council approved the planned gas rebuild expenditures through 2019, but
rejected Entergy New Orleans’s proposed gas infrastructure rider. In April
2020, Entergy New Orleans submitted its gas infrastructure rebuild plan to the
City Council, which maintained the previously proposed timeline and cost
estimates, but included measures to spread out the cost impact to customers of
the program.

  

Renewables

  

In July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council
requesting approval of three utility-scale solar projects totaling 90 MW. If
approved, the resource additions will allow Entergy New Orleans to make
significant progress towards meeting its voluntary commitment to the City
Council to add up to 100 MW of renewable energy resources. The three projects
include constructing a self-build solar plant in Orleans Parish with an output
of 20 MW, acquiring a 50 MW solar facility in Washington Parish through a
build-own-transfer acquisition, and procuring 20 MW of solar power from a
project to be built in St. James Parish through a power purchase agreement. In
December 2018 the City Council advisors requested that Entergy New Orleans
pursue alternative deal structures for the Washington Parish project and
attempt to reduce costs for the 20 MW New Orleans Solar Station. As a result
of settlement discussions, in March 2019, Entergy New Orleans revised its
application to convert the build-own transfer acquisition of the 50 MW
facility in Washington Parish to a power purchase agreement. In June 2019 the
parties to the proceeding executed a stipulated settlement term sheet, which
recommends that the City Council approve Entergy New Orleans’s revised
application as to all three projects. In July 2019 the City Council approved
the stipulated settlement. Commercial operation of the 20 MW New Orleans Solar
Station commenced in December 2020. Entergy New Orleans expects to begin
receiving power under the 50 MW Iris Solar and the 20 MW St. James Solar power
purchase agreements by third quarter 2021.

Entergy New Orleans has a credit facility in the amount of $25 million
scheduled to expire in November 2021. The credit facility includes fronting
commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $10 million of the
borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no
cash borrowings and an $0.8 million letter of credit outstanding under the
facility. In addition, Entergy New Orleans is a party to an uncommitted letter
of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to
MISO. As of December 31, 2020, a $1 million letter of credit was outstanding
under Entergy New Orleans’s letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the
financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

  

Entergy New Orleans obtained authorization from the FERC through July 2022 for
short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $150 million at any
time outstanding and long-term borrowings and securities issuances. See Note 4
to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s
short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New
Orleans are limited to amounts authorized not only by the FERC, but also by
the City Council, and the current City Council authorization extends through
July 2022.

  

State and Local Rate Regulation

  

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas
significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and
liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its
customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the
City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to
customers.

  

Retail Rates

  

Energy Efficiency

  

In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City
Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the Energy Smart
program from April 2020 through December 2022. Entergy New Orleans proposed to
recover the costs of the program through mechanisms previously approved by the
City Council

393

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

or through the energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which was approved in
the 2018 combined rate case resolution. In January 2020 the City Council’s
advisors recommended that, beginning with Program Year 10, the City Council
allow Entergy New Orleans to earn a utility performance incentive of 7% of
Energy Smart costs for each year in which Entergy New Orleans achieves 100% of
the City Council’s savings targets for Energy Smart. In February 2020 the City
Council approved Entergy New Orleans’s application.

  

2018 Base Rate Case

  

In September 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate
case with the City Council. The filing requested a 10.5% return on equity for
electric operations with opportunity to earn a 10.75% return on equity through
a performance adder provision of the electric formula rate plan in subsequent
years under a formula rate plan and requested a 10.75% return on equity for
gas operations. The proposed electric rates in the revised filing reflect a
net reduction of $20.3 million. The reduction in electric rates includes a
base rate increase of $135.2 million, of which $131.5 million is associated
with moving costs currently collected through fuel and other riders into base
rates, plus a request for an advanced metering surcharge to recover $7.1
million associated with advanced metering infrastructure, offset by a net
decrease of $31.1 million related to fuel and other riders. The filing also
included a proposed gas rate decrease of $142 thousand. Entergy New Orleans’s
rates reflected the inclusion of federal income tax reductions due to the Tax
Act and the provisions of a previously-approved agreement in principle
determining how the benefits of the Tax Act would flow. Entergy New Orleans
included cost of service studies for electric and gas operations for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the projected twelve months ending
December 31, 2018. In addition, Entergy New Orleans included capital additions
expected to be placed into service for the period through December 31, 2019.
Entergy New Orleans based its request for a change in rates on the projected
twelve months ending December 31, 2018.

  

The filing’s major provisions included: (1) a new electric rate structure,
which realigns the revenue requirement associated with capacity and long-term
service agreement expense from certain existing riders to base revenue,
provides for the recovery of the cost of advanced metering infrastructure, and
partially blends rates for Entergy New Orleans’s customers residing in Algiers
with customers residing in the remainder of Orleans Parish through a three-
year phase-in; (2) contemporaneous cost recovery riders for investments in
energy efficiency/demand response, incremental changes in capacity/long-term
service agreement costs, grid modernization investment, and gas infrastructure
replacement investment; and (3) formula rate plans for both electric and gas
operations. In February 2019 the City Council’s advisors and several
intervenors filed testimony in response to Entergy New Orleans’s application.
The City Council’s advisors recommended, among other things, overall rate
reductions of approximately $33 million in electric rates and $3.8 million in
gas rates. Certain intervenors recommended overall rate reductions of up to
approximately $49 million in electric rates and $5 million in gas rates. An
evidentiary hearing was held in June 2019, and the record and post-hearing
briefs were submitted in July 2019.

  

In October 2019 the City Council’s Utility Committee approved a resolution for
a change in electric and gas rates for consideration by the full City Council
that included a 9.35% return on common equity, an equity ratio of the lesser
of 50% or Entergy New Orleans’s actual equity ratio, and a total reduction in
revenues that Entergy New Orleans initially estimated to be approximately $39
million ($36 million electric; $3 million gas). At its November 7, 2019
meeting, the full City Council approved the resolution that had previously
been approved by the City Council’s Utility Committee. Based on the approved
resolution, in the fourth quarter 2019 Entergy New Orleans recorded an accrual
of $10 million that reflects the estimate of the revenue billed in 2019 to be
refunded to customers in 2020 based on an August 2019 effective date for the
rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans also recorded a total of $12 million in
regulatory assets for rate case costs and information technology costs
associated with integrating Algiers customers with Entergy New Orleans’s
legacy system and records. Entergy New Orleans will also be allowed to recover
$10 million of retired general plant costs over a 20-year period.

  

The resolution directed Entergy New Orleans to submit a compliance filing
within 30 days of the date of the resolution to facilitate the eventual
implementation of rates, including all necessary calculations and conforming
rate schedules and riders. The electric formula rate plan rider includes,
among other things, 1) a provision for

394

forward-looking adjustments to include known and measurable changes realized
up to 12 months after the evaluation period; 2) a decoupling mechanism; and 3)
recognition that Entergy New Orleans is authorized to make an in-service
adjustment to the formula rate plan to include the non-fuel cost of the New
Orleans Power Station in rates, unless the two pending appeals in the New
Orleans Power Station proceeding have not concluded. Under this circumstance,
Entergy New Orleans shall be permitted to defer the New Orleans Power Station
non-fuel costs, including the cost of capital, until Entergy New Orleans
commences non-fuel cost recovery. After taking into account the requirements
for submission of the compliance filing, the total annual revenue requirement
reduction required by the resolution was refined to approximately $45 million
($42 million electric, including $29 million in rider reductions; $3 million
gas). In January 2020 the City Council’s advisors found that the rates
calculated by Entergy New Orleans and reflected in the December 2019
compliance filing should be implemented, except with respect to the City
Council-approved energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which rider
calculation should take into account events to be determined by the City
Council in the future. Also in response to the resolution, Entergy New Orleans
filed timely a petition for appeal and judicial review and for stay of or
injunctive relief alleging that the resolution is unlawful in failing to
produce just and reasonable rates. A hearing on the requested injunction was
scheduled in Civil District Court for February 2020, but by joint motion of
the City Council and Entergy New Orleans, the Civil District Court issued an
order for a limited remand to the City Council to consider a potential
agreement in principle/stipulation at its February 20, 2020 meeting. On
February 17, 2020, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an
agreement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s
advisors. On February 20, 2020, the City Council voted to approve the proposed
agreement in principle and issued a resolution modifying the required
treatment of certain accumulated deferred income taxes. As a result of the
agreement in principle, the total annual revenue requirement reduction will be
approximately $45 million ($42 million electric, including $29 million in
rider reductions; and $3 million gas). Entergy New Orleans fully implemented
the new rates in April 2020. In January 2021, pursuant to the agreement in
principle approved by the City Council in October 2020, Entergy New Orleans
filed with Civil District Court a motion seeking to dismiss its petition for
judicial review of the City Council’s resolution in the 2018 combined rate
case.

  

Commercial operation of the New Orleans Power Station commenced in May 2020.
In accordance with the City Council resolution issued in the 2018 base rate
case proceeding, Entergy New Orleans had been deferring the New Orleans Power
Station non-fuel costs pending the conclusion of the appellate proceedings. In
October 2020 the Louisiana Supreme Court denied all writ applications relating
to the New Orleans Power Station. With those denials, Entergy New Orleans
began recovering New Orleans Power Station costs in rates in November 2020. As
of December 31, 2020 the regulatory asset for the deferral of New Orleans
Power Station non-fuel costs was $5 million. Entergy New Orleans is recovering
the costs over a five-year period that began in November 2020. In December
2020 the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Sierra Club filed a joint motion
with the City Council to institute a prudence review to investigate the costs
of the New Orleans Power Station. On January 28, 2021, the City Council passed
a resolution giving parties 30 days to respond to the motion. Entergy New
Orleans plans to respond to the motion.

  

2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing

  

Entergy New Orleans’s first annual filing under the three-year formula rate
plan approved by the City Council in November 2019 was originally due to be
filed in April 2020. The authorized return on equity under the approved three-
year formula rate plan is 9.35% for both electric and gas operations. The City
Council approved several extensions of the deadline to allow additional time
to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the New Orleans community,
Entergy New Orleans customers, and Entergy New Orleans itself. In October 2020
the City Council approved an agreement in principle filed by Entergy New
Orleans that results in Entergy New Orleans foregoing its 2020 formula rate
plan filing and shifting the three-year formula rate plan to filings in 2021,
2022, and 2023. Key provisions of the agreement in principle include: changing
the lower of actual equity ratio or 50% equity ratio approved in the rate case
to a hypothetical capital structure of 51% equity and 49% debt for the
duration of the three-year formula rate plan; changing the 2% depreciation
rate for the New Orleans Power Station approved in the rate case to 3%;
retention of over-recovery of $2.2 million in rider revenues; recovery of $1.4
million of certain rate

case expenses outside of the earnings band; recovery of the New Orleans Solar
Station costs upon commercial operation; and Entergy New Orleans’s dismissal
of its 2018 rate case appeal.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In March 2020, Entergy New Orleans voluntarily suspended customer
disconnections for non-payment of utility bills through May 2020.
Subsequently, the City Council ordered that the moratorium be extended to
August 1, 2020. In May 2020 the City Council issued an accounting order
authorizing Entergy New Orleans to establish a regulatory asset for
incremental COVID-19-related expenses. In January 2021, Entergy New Orleans
resumed disconnecting service to commercial and small business customers with
past-due balances that have not made payment arrangements. In February 2021
the City Council adopted a resolution suspending residential customer
disconnections for non-payment of utility bills and suspending the assessment
and accumulation of late fees on residential customers with past-due balances
through May 15, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy New Orleans recorded a
regulatory asset of $14.3 million for costs associated with the COVID-19
pandemic.

  

In June 2020 the City Council established the City Council Cares Program and
directed Entergy New Orleans to use the approximately $7 million refund
received from the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales FERC proceeding,
currently being held in escrow, and approximately $15 million of non-
securitized storm reserves to fund this program, which is intended to provide
temporary bill relief to customers who become unemployed during the COVID-19
pandemic. The program became effective July 1, 2020, and offers qualifying
residential customers bill credits of $100 per month for up to four months,
for a maximum of $400 in residential customer bill credits. As of December 31,
2020, credits of $3.4 million have been applied to customer bills under the
City Council Cares Program.

  

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

  

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff
designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs,
adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the
monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with
fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

  

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to
reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or
credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause,
including carrying charges.

  

Show Cause Order

  

In July 2016 the City Council approved the issuance of a show cause order,
which directed Entergy New Orleans to make a filing on or before September 29,
2016 to demonstrate the reasonableness of its actions or positions with regard
to certain issues in four existing dockets that relate to Entergy New
Orleans’s: (i) storm hardening proposal; (ii) 2015 integrated resource plan;
(iii) gas infrastructure rebuild proposal; and (iv) proposed sizing of the New
Orleans Power Station and its community outreach prior to the filing. In
September 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the City Council’s
show cause order. The City Council has not established any further procedural
schedule with regard to this proceeding.

  

Reliability Investigation

  

In August 2017 the City Council established a docket to investigate the
reliability of the Entergy New Orleans distribution system and to consider
implementing certain reliability standards and possible financial penalties
for not meeting any such standards. In April 2018 the City Council adopted a
resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to demonstrate that it has been
prudent in the management and maintenance of the reliability of its
distribution system. The resolution also called for Entergy New Orleans to
file a revised reliability plan addressing

the current state of its distribution system and proposing remedial measures
for increasing reliability. In June 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its
response to the City Council’s resolution regarding the prudence of its
management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system. In
July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its revised reliability plan discussing
the various reliability programs that it uses to improve distribution system
reliability and discussing generally the positive effect that advanced meter
deployment and grid modernization can have on future reliability. Entergy New
Orleans has retained a national consulting firm with expertise in distribution
system reliability to conduct a review of Entergy New Orleans’s distribution
system reliability-related practices and procedures and to provide
recommendations for improving distribution system reliability. The report was
filed with the City Council in October 2018. The City Council also approved a
resolution that opens a prudence investigation into whether Entergy New
Orleans was imprudent for not acting sooner to address outages in New Orleans
and whether fines should be imposed. In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans
filed testimony in response to the prudence investigation and asserting that
it had been prudent in managing system reliability. In April 2019 the City
Council advisors filed comments and testimony asserting that Entergy New
Orleans did not act prudently in maintaining and improving its distribution
system reliability in recent years and recommending that a financial penalty
in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million should be assessed. Entergy New
Orleans disagrees with the recommendation and submitted rebuttal testimony and
rebuttal comments in June 2019. In November 2019 the City Council passed a
resolution that penalized Entergy New Orleans $1 million for alleged
imprudence in the maintenance of its distribution system. In December 2019,
Entergy New Orleans filed suit in Louisiana state court seeking judicial
review of the City Council’s resolution. Although the City Council evidentiary
record has been lodged with the Civil District count, the court has not yet
established a briefing schedule.

  

Renewable Portfolio Standard Rulemaking

  

In March 2019 the City Council initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider
whether to establish a renewable portfolio standard. The rulemaking will
consider, among other issues, whether to adopt a renewable portfolio standard,
whether such standard should be voluntary or mandatory, what kinds of
technologies should qualify for inclusion in the rules, what level, if any, of
renewable generation should be required, and whether penalties are an
appropriate component of the proposed rules. Parties to the proceeding
submitted initial comments in June 2019 and reply comments in July 2019.
Entergy New Orleans recommends that the City Council adopt a voluntary clean
energy standard of 70% of generation being clean energy by 2030, as so
defined, which, in addition to renewable generation, would include nuclear,
beneficial electrification, and demand-side management as compliant
technologies. Several other industry leaders, academic researchers, and
environmental advocates filed comments also supporting a clean energy
standard. Other parties, including many representatives of the solar and wind
industry, are recommending mandatory, renewables-only requirements of up to
100% renewable resources by 2040. In September 2019 the City Council advisors
issued a report and recommendations, which also put forth three alternative
rules for comment from the parties. Comments were submitted in October 2019
and replies were filed in November 2019. In March 2020 the City Council’s
Utility Committee recommended a resolution for approval by the City Council
that directed the City Council advisors to work toward development of a rule
for enacting a Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard. The four components of
the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard that the City Council expressed a
desire to implement are: (1) a mandatory requirement that Entergy New Orleans
achieve 100% net zero carbon emissions by 2040; (2) reliance on renewable
energy credits purchased without the associated energy for compliance with the
standard being phased out over the ten-year period from 2040 to 2050; (3) no
carbon-emitting resources in the portfolio of resources Entergy New Orleans
uses to serve New Orleans by 2050; and (4) a mechanism to limit costs in any
one plan year to no more than one percent of plan year total utility retail
sales revenues. The City Council adopted the Utility Committee resolution in
April 2020. The first technical meeting of the parties occurred in June 2020;
a second technical meeting occurred in July 2020. In August 2020 the City
Council advisors issued a final draft of the rules for review and comment from
the parties before final rules are proposed for consideration by the City
Council. Entergy New Orleans filed comments in September and October 2020. A
City Council decision is expected in the first quarter 2021.

Environmental Risks

  

Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by
various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water
quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations.

Entergy New Orleans’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported
costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by
numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee
demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting
mechanisms. See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in

long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the member and Board of Directors of

Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy New
Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and
2019, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes
in member’s equity (pages 402 through 406 and applicable items in pages 51
through 238), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters— Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries — Refer
to Note 2 to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Council of the City of New
Orleans, Louisiana (the “City Council”), which has jurisdiction with respect
to the rates of electric companies in the City of New Orleans, Louisiana, and
to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its
financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects
of cost-based

400

rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts
multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property,
plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes;
operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation and
amortization expense.

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the City Council and the FERC set the rates
the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including
a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that
require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation,
including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company
assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to
meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance
sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes
consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for
similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and
political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover
costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the City
Council and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of
providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the
utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery
in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing
management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the City
Council and the FERC, involved especially subjective judgment and specialized
knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
City Council and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the City Council and the FERC
for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes,
interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and
other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the City
Council’s and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar
circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to
management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for
completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with
the City Council and the FERC, including the base rate case filing, and
considered the filings with the City Council and the FERC by intervenors that
may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict
management’s assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s
assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in
rates.

ENTERGY TEXAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

  

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

The COVID-19 Pandemic

  

See “The COVID-19 Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta

  

In August 2020 and October 2020, Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta caused
extensive damage to Entergy Texas’s service area. The storm resulted in
widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution and
transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages.
Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Texas’s
electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta are
currently estimated to be approximately $300 million, including $245 million
in capital costs and approximately $55 million in non-capital costs. Entergy
Texas is considering all available avenues to recover storm-related costs from
Hurricanes Laura and Hurricane Delta, including securitization. Storm cost
recovery or financing will be subject to review by applicable regulatory
authorities.

  

Entergy Texas recorded accounts payable and corresponding construction work in
progress and regulatory assets for the estimated costs incurred that were
necessary to return customers to service. Entergy Texas recorded the
regulatory assets in accordance with its accounting policies and based on the
historic treatment of such costs in its service area because management
believes that recovery through some form of regulatory mechanism is probable.
There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these
catastrophic events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm
costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because
Entergy Texas has not gone through the regulatory process regarding these
storm costs, there is an element of risk, and Entergy Texas is unable to
predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery
initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover,
or the timing of such recovery.

  

February 2021 Winter Storms

  

See the “February 2021 Winter Storms” section of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion
of the February 2021 winter storms. Entergy Texas’s preliminary estimate for
the cost of mobilizing crews and restoring power is approximately $12 million.
Natural gas purchases for Entergy Texas for February 1st through 25th, 2021
are approximately $155 million compared to natural gas purchases for February
2020 of $10 million.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income increased $55.7 million primarily due to higher retail electric
price, higher other income, lower other operation and maintenance expenses, a
lower effective income tax rate, after excluding the effect of the return of
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers which is
offset in income taxes, and higher volume/weather. The increase was partially
offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Operating Revenues

  

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenue comparing 2020 to
2019.

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Amount |  |  |  |  | |
|(In Millions) |  |  |  |  | |
|2019 operating revenues | $1,489.0 |  |  |  | |
|Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income | 4.4 |  |  |  | |
|Return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers | 58.6 |  |  |  | |
|Retail electric price | 28.1 |  |  |  | |
|Volume/weather | 7.0 |  |  |  | |
|2020 operating revenues | $1,587.1 |  |  |  | |
  
  

Entergy Texas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to
recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and
expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net
income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net
income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

  

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to
customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred
income taxes through a rider effective October 2018. In 2020, $28.8 million
was returned to customers as compared to $87.4 million in 2019. There is no
effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues is offset by a
reduction in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the
transmission cost recovery factor rider effective January 2020 and an increase
in the distribution cost recovery factor rider effective October 2020. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the transmission
and distribution cost recovery factor rider filings.

  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in usage during
the unbilled sales period and an increase in billed residential usage as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the effect of less
favorable weather on residential sales and decreased commercial and industrial
usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in industrial usage
is partially offset by an increase in demand from expansion projects,
primarily in the chemicals and transportation industries. See “The COVID-19
Pandemic” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Other Income Statement Variances

  

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $7.7 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due
to a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2020 as compared to
the same period in 2019, including a delay in plant outages as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic; and

•a decrease of $3.7 million primarily due to contract costs in 2019 related to
initiatives to explore new customer products and services.

  

The decrease was partially offset by $2.3 million of transaction costs
incurred in connection with the purchase of the Hardin County Peaking Facility
and the partial sale of Montgomery County Power Station.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to
plant in service.

  

Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for
equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in
progress in 2020, including the Montgomery County Power Station project.

  

The effective income tax rates were 1.4% for 2020 and (51.1%) for 2019. The
difference in the effective income tax rates versus the federal statutory rate
of 21% for 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess
accumulated deferred income taxes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial
statements for a discussion of the effects and regulatory activity regarding
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a
reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income
tax rates.

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $88.6 million in 2020
compared to 2019 primarily due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased
power costs and a decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated
deferred income taxes to customers. The increase was partially offset by lower
collections of receivables from customers, in part due to the COVID-19
pandemic, and increased storm spending. See Note 2 to the financial statements
for further discussion of the regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act. See “Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta” above for discussion of
hurricane restoration efforts.

Table of Contents

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $29.6 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•a decrease of $158.8 million in non-nuclear generation construction
expenditures primarily due to the Montgomery County Power Station in 2020 as
compared to 2019;

•a decrease of $9.9 million in information technology capital expenditures
primarily due to decreased spending on various technology projects; and

•money pool activity.

  

The decrease was partially offset by:

  

•an increase of $93.8 million in storm spending in 2020, primarily due to
Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta restoration efforts. See “Hurricane Laura
and Hurricane Delta” above for discussion of hurricane restoration efforts;

•an increase of $43.9 million in distribution construction expenditures,
primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy
Texas’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering
infrastructure; and

•an increase of $29.8 million in transmission construction expenditures
primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2020 as compared to 2019.

  

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of
cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by
$6.6 million in 2020 compared to increasing $11.2 million in 2019. The money
pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility
subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

  

Financing Activities

  

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $104.6 million from
2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:

  

•the issuance of $600 million of 1.75% Series mortgage bonds in October 2020;

•the repayment, at maturity, of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds
in February 2019;

•the issuance of $175 million of 3.55% Series mortgage bonds in March 2020;
and

•money pool activity.

  

The increase was partially offset by:

  

•the issuances of $300 million of 4.0% Series mortgage bonds and $400 million
of 4.5% Series mortgage bonds, each in January 2019;

•the issuance of $300 million of 3.55% Series mortgage bonds in September
2019;

•the repayment of $135 million of 5.625% Series mortgage bonds in November
2020;

•the issuance of $35 million aggregate liquidation value 5.375% Series A
preferred stock in September 2019; and

•the payment of $30 million of common stock dividends in 2020. No common stock
dividends were paid in 2019 as a result of upcoming capital expenditures,
including Montgomery County Power Station.

  

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow,
and Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool decreased $22.4 million in 2019.

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital
Resources \- Cash Flow” in Item 7 of Entergy Texas’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21,
2020, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow
activities for 2019 compared to 2018.

  

Capital Structure

  

Entergy Texas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The
increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Texas is primarily due to
the net issuance of $640 million of mortgage bonds in 2020, partially offset
by the $175 million capital contribution received from Entergy Corporation in
2020 and net income in 2020.

|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|(a) | Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to |  |  |  | |
Entergy Texas.  
  
  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of
finance lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing
portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital
less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios
excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and
believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in
evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because the securitization
bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to
the financial statements. Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital
ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and
believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in
evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because net debt indicates
Entergy Texas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied
by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

  

Entergy Texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its
regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.
To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned
investments, Entergy Texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or
both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, Entergy Texas may
receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain
circumstances such as financing of large transactions that would materially
alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced
dividends.

  

Uses of Capital

  

Entergy Texas requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
costs; and

•dividend and interest payments.

expects to pay for $180 million of capital investments in 2021 related to
Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta restoration work that have been accrued as
of December 31, 2020.

  

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s existing debt and lease

(b)Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or
cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.
For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased
power obligations.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects
to contribute approximately $7 million to its qualified pension plans and
approximately $66 thousand to other postretirement health care and life
insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required pension contributions will
be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2021 valuations are
completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See “Critical Accounting
Estimates \- Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a
discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

  

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $14.2
million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes
and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be
reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective
settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

  

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned
capital investment estimate for Entergy Texas includes specific investments
such as the Liberty County Power Station and the Hardin County Peaking
Facility; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and
enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and
improve service to customers, including advanced meters and related
investments; resource planning, including potential generation and renewables
projects; system improvements; software and security; and other investments.
Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification
and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and
requirements,

access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt in Note
5 to the financial statements.

  

As a subsidiary, Entergy Texas dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation
at a percentage determined monthly.

  

Liberty County Solar Facility

  

In September 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to
amend Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to acquire the
100 MW Liberty County Solar Facility and a determination that Entergy Texas’s
acquisition of the facility through a tax equity partnership is in the public
interest. In its preliminary order, the PUCT determined that, in considering
Entergy Texas’s application, it would not specifically address whether Entergy
Texas’s use of a tax equity partnership is in the public interest. A
procedural schedule was established with a hearing on the merits scheduled in
April 2021. Closing is expected to occur in 2023.

  

Hardin County Peaking Facility

  

In April 2020, Entergy Texas and East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed a
joint report and application seeking PUCT approvals related to two
transactions: (1) Entergy Texas’s acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking
Facility from East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.; and (2) Entergy Texas’s
sale of a 7.55% partial interest in the Montgomery County Power Station to
East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. The two transactions, currently
scheduled to close in April 2021 (pending PUCT approval), are interdependent.
In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement
supporting approval of the transactions. Key provisions of the settlement
include: Entergy Texas will propose to depreciate its investment in Hardin
County Peaking Facility through the end of 2041; Entergy Texas’s recovery of
its investment in Hardin County Peaking Facility will be capped at
approximately $36 million; and Entergy Texas will not seek recovery of an
acquisition adjustment, if any, or transaction costs for either transaction.
The settlement is currently pending before the PUCT.

  

Sources of Capital

  

Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

  

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt or preferred stock issuances, including debt issuances to refund or
retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;

•capital contributions; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

  

Entergy Texas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to
maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are
favorable.

  

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require
prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests
set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy Texas has
sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

  

Entergy Texas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

  

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to
expire in September 2024. The credit facility includes fronting commitments
for the issuance of letters of credit against $30 million of the borrowing
capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no cash
borrowings and $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit
facility. In addition, Entergy Texas is a party to an uncommitted letter of
credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to
MISO. As of December 31, 2020, $6.2 million in letters of credit were
outstanding under Entergy Texas’s letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the
financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

  

Entergy Texas obtained authorizations from the FERC through July 2022 for
short-term borrowings, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at
any time outstanding, and long-term borrowings and security issuances. See
Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s
short-term borrowing limits.

  

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

  

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence
its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is
regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory
proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for
approval of the rates charged to customers.

  

Filings with the PUCT

  

2018 Rate Case

  

In May 2018, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking an
increase in base rates and rider rates of approximately $166 million, of which
$48 million is associated with moving costs currently being collected through
riders into base rates such that the total incremental revenue requirement
increase is approximately $118 million. The base rate case was based on a
12-month test year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, Entergy Texas
included capital additions placed into service for the period of April 1, 2013
through December 31, 2017, as well as a post-test year adjustment to include
capital additions placed in service by June 30, 2018.

  

In October 2018 the parties filed an unopposed settlement resolving all issues
in the proceeding and a motion for interim rates effective for usage on and
after October 17, 2018. The unopposed settlement reflects the following terms:
a base rate increase of $53.2 million (net of costs realigned from riders and
including updated depreciation rates), a $25 million refund to reflect the
lower federal income tax rate applicable to Entergy Texas from January 25,
2018 through the date new rates are implemented, $6 million of capitalized
skylining tree hazard costs will not be recovered from customers, $242.5
million of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes
a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through base rates under the
average rate assumption method over the lives of the associated assets, and
$185.2 million of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which
includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through a rider. The
unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes rider will include
carrying charges and will be in effect over a period of 12 months for large
customers and over a period of four years for other customers. The settlement
also provides for the deferral of $24.5 million of costs associated with the
remaining book value of the Neches and Sabine 2 plants, previously taken out
of service, to be recovered over a ten-year period and the deferral of $20.5
million of costs associated with Hurricane Harvey to be recovered over a
12-year period, each beginning in October 2018. The settlement provides final
resolution of all issues in the matter, including those related to the Tax
Act. In October 2018 the ALJ granted the unopposed motion for interim rates to
be effective for service rendered on or after October 17, 2018. In December
2018 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.

Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider

  

In March 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF
rider. The proposed new DCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $3.2
million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital
invested in distribution between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018. In
September 2019 the PUCT issued an order approving rates, which had been
effective on an interim basis since June 2019, at the level proposed in
Entergy Texas’s application.

  

In March 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $23.6 million annually, or $20.4 million in
incremental annual DCRF revenue beyond Entergy Texas’s then-effective DCRF
rider, based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2019
and December 31, 2019. In May and June 2020 intervenors filed testimony
recommending reductions in Entergy Texas’s annual revenue requirement of
approximately $0.3 million and $4.1 million. The parties briefed the contested
issues in this matter and a proposal for decision was issued in September 2020
recommending a $4.1 million revenue reduction related to non-Advanced Metering
System meters included in the DCRF calculation. The parties filed exceptions
to the proposal for decision and replies to those exceptions in September
2020. In October 2020 the PUCT issued a final order approving a $16.3 million
incremental annual DCRF revenue increase.

  

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $26.3 million annually, or $6.8 million in incremental
annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s currently effective DCRF rider based on
its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2020 and August 31,
2020. In February 2021 the administrative law judge with the State Office of
Administrative Hearings approved Entergy Texas's agreed motion for interim
rates, which will go into effect in March 2021. The administrative law judge
also adopted a procedural schedule setting a hearing on the merits, if
necessary, in April 2021.

  

Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider

  

In December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new
TCRF rider. The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately
$2.7 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its
capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30,
2018. In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth
adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas’s proposed TCRF revenue
requirement. In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas’s application as
filed to begin recovery of the requested $2.7 million annual revenue
requirement, rejecting opposing parties’ proposed adjustment; however, the
PUCT found that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should
be determined in Entergy Texas’s next rate case similar to the procedure used
for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider. In October 2019 the PUCT
issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior
order granting Entergy Texas’s application as filed. Also, in October 2019 a
second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in
opposition to the motion. The second motion for rehearing was overruled by
operation of law. In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an
appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in
declining to apply a load growth adjustment.

  

In August 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF
rider. The amended TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $19.4
million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital
invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, which is
$16.7 million in incremental annual revenue above the $2.7 million approved in
the prior pending TCRF proceeding. In January 2020 the PUCT issued an order
approving an unopposed settlement providing for recovery of the requested
revenue requirement. Entergy Texas implemented the amended rider beginning
with bills covering usage on and after January 23, 2020.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF
rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail
customers approximately $51 million annually, or $31.6 million in incremental
annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s currently effective TCRF rider based on
its capital invested in transmission between July 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020.
A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in March 2021.
In February 2021, Entergy Texas filed an agreed motion to abate the procedural
schedule, noting that the parties had reached a settlement in principle, and
the administrative law judge granted the motion to abate.

  

Generation Cost Recovery Rider

  

In October 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to establish a generation
cost recovery rider with an initial annual revenue requirement of
approximately $91 million to begin recovering a return of and on its capital
investment in the Montgomery County Power Station through August 31, 2020. In
December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement supporting a
generation cost recovery rider with an annual revenue requirement of
approximately $86 million. The settlement revenue requirement is based on a
depreciation rate intended to fully depreciate Montgomery County Power Station
over 38 years and the removal of certain costs from Entergy Texas’s request.
Under the settlement, Entergy Texas retains the right to propose a different
depreciation rate and seek recovery of a majority of the costs removed from
its request in its next base rate proceeding. On January 14, 2021, the PUCT
approved the generation cost recovery rider settlement rates on an interim
basis and abated the proceeding. Within 60 days of Montgomery County Power
Station being placed in service on January 1, 2021, Entergy Texas will file to
update its generation cost recovery rider to include investment in Montgomery
County Power Station after August 31, 2020. The current estimated cost of
Montgomery County Power Station, including transmission interconnection and
network upgrades, is approximately $921 million. Of this investment,
approximately $756 million is eligible to begin being recovered through the
generation cost recovery rider. Entergy Texas will address recovery of the
remainder of its Montgomery County Power Station investment through other rate
mechanisms.

  

In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to amend its generation
cost recovery rider to reflect its acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking
Facility, which is expected to close in April 2021. The initial generation
cost recovery rider rates proposed in the application represent no change from
the generation cost recovery rider rates to be established in Entergy Texas’s
previous generation cost recovery rider proceeding. Once Entergy Texas has
acquired the Hardin County Peaking Facility, its investment in the facility
will be reflected in the updated filing to Entergy Texas’s application, which
will be made within 60 days of the acquisition’s closing.

  

COVID-19 Orders

  

In March 2020 the PUCT authorized electric utilities to record as a regulatory
asset expenses resulting from the effects of COVID-19. In future proceedings
the PUCT will consider whether each utility's request for recovery of these
regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, the appropriate period of
recovery, and any amount of carrying costs thereon. In March 2020 the PUCT
ordered a moratorium on disconnections for nonpayment for all customer
classes, but, in April 2020, revised the disconnect moratorium to apply only
to residential customers. The PUCT allowed the moratorium to expire on June
13, 2020, but on July 17, 2020, the PUCT re-established the disconnect
moratorium for residential customers until August 31, 2020. In January 2021,
Entergy Texas resumed disconnections for customers with past-due balances that
have not made payment arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, Entergy Texas
recorded a regulatory asset of $12.9 million for costs associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic.

  

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

  

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and
purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates. Semi-
annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March

and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel
mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any
interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings
before the PUCT. A fuel reconciliation is required to be filed at least once
every three years and outside of a base rate case filing.

  

In December 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of
approximately $30.5 million for the months of May 2017 through October 2017.
Also in December 2017, the PUCT’s ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis.
For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills January 2018 through
March 2018. The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in March 2018.

  

In September 2019, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel
and purchased power costs for the period from April 2016 through March 2019.
During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.6
billion in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses,
net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.
Entergy Texas estimated an under-recovery balance of approximately $25.8
million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry
over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period
beginning April 2019. In March 2020 an intervenor filed testimony proposing
that the PUCT disallow: (1) $2 million in replacement power costs associated
with generation outages during the reconciliation period; and (2) $24.4
million associated with the operation of the Spindletop natural gas storage
facility during the reconciliation period. In April 2020, Entergy Texas filed
rebuttal testimony refuting all points raised by the intervenor. In June 2020
the parties filed a stipulation and settlement agreement, which included a
$1.2 million disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised by
any party. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2020.

  

In July 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an
interim fuel refund of $25.5 million, including interest. Entergy Texas
proposed that the interim fuel refund be implemented beginning with the first
August 2020 billing cycle over a three-month period for smaller customers and
in a lump sum amount in the billing month of August 2020 for transmission-
level customers. The interim fuel refund was approved in July 2020, and
Entergy Texas began refunds in August 2020.

  

In February 2021, Entergy Texas filed an application to implement a fuel
refund for a cumulative over-recovery of approximately $75 million that is
primarily attributable to settlements received by Entergy Texas from MISO
related to Hurricane Laura. Entergy Texas planned to issue the refund over the
period of March through August 2021. On February 22, 2021, Entergy Texas filed
a motion to abate its fuel refund proceeding to assess how the February 2021
winter storm impacted Entergy Texas’s fuel over-recovery position.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

  

Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore
ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option
available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base. Entergy
Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and
negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate
schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load

profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development,
customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and
commercial demand, from both new and existing customers.

  

Environmental Risks

  

Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce
estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy
Texas’s financial position or results of operations.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

  

Entergy Texas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as
described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous
factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics,
and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.
See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical
Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s
estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

  

Cost Sensitivity

Costs and Employer Contributions

  

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2020 was $12.4 million,
including $4.3 million in settlement costs. Entergy Texas anticipates 2021
qualified pension cost to be $8.9 million. Entergy Texas contributed $5
million to its qualified pension plans in 2020 and estimates 2021 pension

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Texas,
Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in common
equity (pages 423 through 428 and applicable items in pages 51 through 238),
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries — Refer to
Note 2 to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Public Utility Commission of
Texas (the “PUCT”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of
electric companies in Texas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized
rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for
the economics of rate

421

regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures,
such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities;
income taxes; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and
depreciation and amortization expense.

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the PUCT and the FERC set the rates the
Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a
reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that
require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation,
including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company
assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to
meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance
sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes
consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for
similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and
political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover
costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the PUCT
and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing
utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility
business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery
in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing
management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the PUCT
and the FERC, involved especially subjective judgment and specialized
knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
PUCT and the FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the PUCT and the FERC for the
Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly
available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or
of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the PUCT’s and the
FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated
the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory
asset and liability balances for completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with
the PUCT and the FERC, including the base rate case filing, and considered the
filings with the PUCT and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the
Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s
assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s
assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in
rates.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

  

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

  

System Energy’s principal asset consists of an ownership interest and a
leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90%
interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four
customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans. System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the
allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90%
interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of
operating revenues. As discussed in “Complaints Against System Energy” below,
System Energy is currently involved in proceedings at the FERC commenced by
the retail regulators of its customers regarding its return on equity, its
capital structure, its renewal of the sale-leaseback of 11.5% of Grand Gulf,
the treatment of uncertain tax positions in rate base, and the rates it
charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

  

Results of Operations

  

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Net Income

  

Net income remained relatively unchanged. An increase in operating revenues
resulting from changes in rate base was substantially offset by higher
provisions against revenue, as compared to prior year. A provision for rate
refund was recorded in 2020 to reflect a one-time credit of $25.2 million
provided for in the Federal Power Act section 205 filing made by System Energy
in December 2020. Provisions against revenue were recorded in 2019 in
connection with the return on equity complaint against System Energy. See
“Complaints Against System Energy” below for further discussion of these items
and other proceedings involving System Energy at the FERC. The one-time credit
is discussed in the Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain
Tax Position Rate Base Issue part of that section. The return on equity
complaint is discussed in the Return on Equity and Capital Structure
Complaints part of that section.

  

Income Taxes

  

The effective income tax rates were 17.2% for 2020 and 13.4% for 2019. See
Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal
statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Results of Operations”
in Item 7 of System Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2020, for discussion of
results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.

2020 Compared to 2019

  

Operating Activities

  

System Energy’s operating activities used $145.5 million of cash in 2020
compared to providing $300.1 million of cash in 2019 primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $382 million in income taxes paid in 2020. System Energy made
income tax payments of $384.3 million in 2020 in accordance with an
intercompany income tax allocation agreement. The 2020 income tax payments are
primarily related to the resolution of the 2014-2015 IRS audit regarding the
treatment of nuclear decommissioning costs included in cost of goods sold,
which is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements in Tax Accounting
Methods;

•an increase in spending of $34.9 million on nuclear refueling outages in 2020
as compared to prior year; and

•timing of payments to vendors.

  

The increase in cash used was offset by proceeds of $35 million received in
December 2020 from the DOE resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear
fuel storage costs that were previously expensed. See Note 8 to the financial
statements for a discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.

  

Investing Activities

  

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by $86.9 million in 2020
primarily due to:

  

•an increase of $77.2 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel
activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of
fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of
cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

•an increase of $28 million in nuclear construction expenditures as a result
of spending in 2020 on Grand Gulf outage projects.

  

The increase was partially offset by money pool activity and proceeds of $5.5
million received in December 2020 from the DOE resulting from litigation
regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized.
See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear
fuel litigation.

System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Decreases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a source of
cash flow and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool decreased by
$55.3 million in 2020 compared to decreasing by $47.8 million in 2019. The
money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the
Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

  

Financing Activities

  

System Energy’s financing activities provided $525.8 million of cash in 2020
compared to using $207.7 million of cash in 2019 primarily due to the
following activity:

  

•a $350 million capital contribution from Entergy Corporation in order to
maintain System Energy’s capital structure in conjunction with the tax
payments discussed in “Operating Activities”;

•the issuance in December 2020 of $200 million of 2.14% Series mortgage bonds;

•the issuance in October 2020 of $90 million of 2.05% Series K notes by the
System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;

•a decrease in net repayments of $50.7 million of long-term borrowings in 2020
on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility; and

•a decrease of $43.6 million in common stock dividends and distributions in
2020 in order to maintain System Energy’s capital structure.

  

See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details of long-term
debt.

  

2019 Compared to 2018

  

See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \- Liquidity and Capital
Resources \- Cash Flow” in Item 7 of System Energy’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21,
2020, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow
activities for 2019 compared to 2018.

  

Capital Structure

  

System Energy’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The
decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the capital
contribution from Entergy Corporation, partially offset by the issuance of
long-term debt in 2020.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|

|2020 |  | December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
2019  
Debt to capital | 42.7 | % |  | 43.5 | %
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Effect of subtracting cash | (8.5 | %) |  | (3.3 | %)
Net debt to net capital | 34.2 | % |  | 40.2 | %
  
  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of
short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing
portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of
capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the debt to capital
ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful
information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s
financial condition. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in
analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information
to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial
condition because net debt indicates System Energy’s outstanding debt position
that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

System Energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its
regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also
maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade
debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned
investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a
dividend or a capital distribution, or a combination of the three, in
appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that
operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments and other
uses of cash, System Energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or
both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, System Energy may
receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain
circumstances that would materially alter the capital structure if financed
entirely with debt and reduced dividends.

  

Uses of Capital

  

System Energy requires capital resources for:

  

•construction and other capital investments;

•debt maturities or retirements;

•working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs and tax
payments; and

•dividend, distribution, and interest payments.

  

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other
capital investments.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

(a)Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5
to the financial statements.

(b)Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or
cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.
For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.

  

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects
to contribute approximately $18.7 million to its qualified pension plans and
approximately $22 thousand to other postretirement health care and life
insurance plans in 2021, although the 2021 required pension contributions will
be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2021 valuations are
completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021. See “Critical Accounting
Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below for a
discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

  

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $14.2
million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes
and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be
reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective
settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital
investment estimate includes specific Grand Gulf investments and initiatives.

  

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy
Corporation at a percentage determined monthly.

  

Sources of Capital

  

System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

  

•internally generated funds;

•cash on hand;

•debt issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently
outstanding or maturing indebtedness;

•equity contributions; and

•bank financing under new or existing facilities.

  

System Energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to
maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

  

All debt issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt
issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture
and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests
to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

  

System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December
31 for each of the following years.

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

Complaints Against System Energy

  

Return on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints

  

In January 2017 the APSC and MPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against
System Energy. The complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity
component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy
sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. Entergy Arkansas also
sells some of its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under separate agreements. The current
return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is 10.94%, which was
established in a rate proceeding that became final in July 2001.

  

The APSC and MPSC complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and
unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it
is excessive. The complaint requests proceedings to investigate the return on
equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the FERC
establish January 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. The complaint includes
return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of
reasonable return on equity for System Energy is between 8.37% and 8.67%.
System Energy answered the complaint in February 2017 and disputes that a
return on equity of 8.37% to 8.67% is just and reasonable. The LPSC and the
City Council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the
complaint. In September 2017 the FERC established a refund effective date of
January 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings
before an ALJ. The parties have been unable to settle the return on equity
issue and a FERC hearing judge was assigned in July 2018. The 15-month refund
period in connection with the APSC/MPSC complaint expired on April 23, 2018.

  

In April 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy
seeking an additional 15-month refund period. The LPSC complaint requests
similar relief from the FERC with respect to System Energy’s return on equity
and also requests the FERC to investigate System Energy’s capital structure.
The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer
expressing support for the complaint, and asked the FERC to consolidate this
proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the APSC and MPSC
in January 2017. System Energy answered the LPSC complaint in May 2018 and
also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In August 2018 the FERC issued
an order dismissing the LPSC’s request to investigate System Energy’s capital
structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a
refund effective date of April 27, 2018. The 15-month refund period in
connection with the LPSC return on equity complaint expired on July 26, 2019.

  

The portion of the LPSC’s complaint dealing with return on equity was
subsequently consolidated with the APSC and MPSC complaint for hearing. The
parties addressed an order (issued in a separate proceeding involving New
England transmission owners) that proposed modifying the FERC’s standard
methodology for determining return on equity. In September 2018, System Energy
filed a request for rehearing and the LPSC filed a request for rehearing or
reconsideration of the FERC’s August 2018 order. The LPSC’s request referenced
an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital
structure claim the FERC had earlier dismissed. The FERC initiated a new
proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and System Energy
submitted a response in October 2018. In January 2019 the FERC set the amended
complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings. Settlement proceedings in
the capital structure proceeding commenced in February 2019. As noted below,
in June 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital
structure complaint was consolidated with the ongoing return on equity
proceeding. The 15-month refund period in connection with the capital
structure complaint was from September 24, 2018 to December 23, 2019.

  

In January 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed direct testimony in the
return on equity proceeding. For the refund period January 23, 2017 through
April 23, 2018, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System
Energy of 7.81% and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity
for System Energy of 8.24%. For the refund period April 27, 2018 through July
27, 2019, and for application on a

prospective basis, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for
System Energy of 7.97% and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on
equity for System Energy of 8.41%. In March 2019, System Energy submitted
answering testimony. For the first refund period, System Energy’s testimony
argues for a return on equity of 10.10% (median) or 10.70% (midpoint). For the
second refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that the calculated
returns on equity for the first period fall within the range of presumptively
just and reasonable returns on equity, and thus the second complaint should be
dismissed (and the first period return on equity used going forward). If the
FERC nonetheless were to set a new return on equity for the second period (and
going forward), System Energy argues the return on equity should be either
10.32% (median) or 10.69% (midpoint).

  

In May 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in
the return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial
staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.89%
based on the application of FERC’s proposed methodology. The FERC trial
staff’s direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on
equity of 9.89% for the first refund period was within the range of
presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund
period, as calculated using a study period ending January 31, 2019 for the
second refund period.

  

In June 2019, System Entergy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed
by the FERC trial staff. Among other things, System Energy’s testimony
rebutted arguments raised by the FERC trial staff and provided updated
calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending May
31, 2019. For that refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that strict
application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the FERC staff
indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return
on equity would be set at 9.65% (median) or 9.74% (midpoint). System Energy’s
testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks
such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes
that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either
9.91% (median) or 10.3% (midpoint). System Energy’s testimony also argues
that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the 10.10%
return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the
range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second
refund period.

  

Also in June 2019, the FERC’s Chief ALJ issued an order terminating settlement
discussions in the amended complaint addressing System Energy’s capital
structure. The ALJ consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with
the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for
the consolidated hearing.

  

In August 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed rebuttal testimony in the
return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to
System Energy’s capital structure. The LPSC re-argues for an authorized return
on equity for System Energy of 7.81% for the first refund period and 7.97% for
the second refund period. The APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on
equity for System Energy of 8.26% for the first refund period and 8.32% for
the second refund period. With respect to capital structure, the LPSC proposes
that the FERC establish a hypothetical capital structure for System Energy for
ratemaking purposes. Specifically, the LPSC proposes that System Energy’s
common equity ratio be set to Entergy Corporation’s equity ratio of 37% equity
and 63% debt. In the alternative, the LPSC argues that the equity ratio should
be no higher than 49%, the composite equity ratio of System Energy and the
other Entergy operating companies who purchase under the Unit Power Sales
Agreement. The APSC and MPSC recommend that 35.98% be set as the common equity
ratio for System Energy. As an alternative, the APSC and MPSC propose that
System Energy’s common equity be set at 46.75% based on the median equity
ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity.

  

In September 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the
return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff
calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.40% based on
the application of the FERC’s proposed methodology and an updated proxy group.
For the second refund period, based on the study period ending May 31, 2019,
the FERC trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of
9.63%. In September 2019 the FERC trial staff also filed direct and answering
testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure. The FERC trial staff
argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop
System Energy’s return on equity should be used to establish the capital
structure. Using this

approach, the FERC trial staff calculates the average capital structure for
its proposed proxy group of 46.74% common equity, and 53.26% debt.

  

In October 2019, System Energy filed answering testimony disputing the FERC
trial staff’s, the LPSC’s, and the APSC’s and MPSC’s arguments for the use of
a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of System Energy’s
actual capital structure is just and reasonable.

  

In November 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve System Energy, the FERC
issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on
equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO. Thereafter, the procedural
schedule in the System Energy proceeding was amended to allow the participants
to file supplemental testimony addressing the order in the MISO transmission
owner proceeding (Opinion No. 569).

  

In February 2020 the LPSC, the MPSC and APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed
supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569 and how it would affect the
return on equity evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System
Energy. For the first refund period, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.44%; the MPSC and APSC
argue for an authorized return on equity of 8.41%; and the FERC trial staff
argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.22%. For the second refund
period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.89%; the MPSC and APSC
argue that an authorized return on equity of 8.01% may be appropriate; and the
FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 8.66%.

  

In April 2020, System Energy filed supplemental answering testimony addressing
Opinion No. 569. System Energy argues that the Opinion No. 569 methodology is
conceptually and analytically defective for purposes of establishing just and
reasonable authorized return on equity determinations and proposes an
alternative approach. As its primary recommendation, System Energy continues
to support the return on equity determinations in its March 2019 testimony for
the first refund period and its June 2019 testimony for the second refund
period. Under the Opinion No. 569 methodology, System Energy calculates a
“presumptively just and reasonable range” for the authorized return on equity
for the first refund period of 8.57% to 9.52%, and for the second refund
period of 8.28% to 9.11%. System Energy argues that these ranges are not just
and reasonable results. Under its proposed alternative methodology, System
Energy calculates an authorized return on equity of 10.26% for the first
refund period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable
range calculated for the second refund period and prospectively.

  

In May 2020 the FERC issued an order on rehearing of Opinion No. 569 (Opinion
No. 569-A). In June 2020 the procedural schedule in the System Energy
proceeding was further revised in order to allow parties to address the
Opinion No. 569-A methodology. Pursuant to the revised schedule, in June 2020,
the LPSC, MPSC and APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed supplemental testimony
addressing Opinion No. 569-A and how it would affect the return on equity
evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System Energy. For the
first refund period, based on their respective interpretations and
applications of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.97%; the MPSC and APSC
argue for an authorized return on equity of 9.24%; and the FERC trial staff
argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.49%. For the second refund
period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations
and applications of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an
authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.78%; the MPSC and APSC
argue that an authorized return on equity of 9.15% may be appropriate if the
second complaint is not dismissed; and the FERC trial staff argues for an
authorized return on equity of 9.09% if the second complaint is not dismissed.

  

Pursuant to the revised procedural schedule, in July 2020, System Energy filed
supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569-A. System Energy argues that
strict application of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology produces results
inconsistent with investor requirements and does not provide a sound basis on
which

to evaluate System Energy’s authorized return on equity. As its primary
recommendation, System Energy argues for the use of a methodology that
incorporates four separate financial models, including the constant growth
form of the discounted cash flow model and the empirical capital asset pricing
model. Based on application of its recommended methodology, System Energy
argues for an authorized return on equity of 10.12% for the first refund
period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable range
calculated for the second refund period and prospectively. Under the Opinion
No. 569-A methodology, System Energy calculates an authorized return on equity
of 9.44% for the first refund period, which also falls within the
presumptively just and reasonable range calculated for the second refund
period and prospectively.

  

The parties and FERC trial staff filed final rounds of testimony in August
2020. The hearing before a FERC ALJ occurred in late-September through early-
October 2020, post-hearing briefing took place in November and December 2020,
and the initial decision is due in March 2021. System Energy recorded a
provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.

  

Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate
Base Issue

  

In May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy
Services related to System Energy’s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction
originally entered into in December 1988 for an 11.5% undivided interest in
Grand Gulf Unit 1. The complaint alleges that System Energy violated the filed
rate and the FERC’s ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in
Unit Power Sales Agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated
with the sale-leaseback interest, and that System Energy is double-recovering
costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in Unit
Power Sales Agreement billings. The complaint also claims that System Energy
was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the Utility
operating companies that purchase Grand Gulf’s output from System Energy could
have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the MISO markets. The complaint
further alleges that System Energy violated various other reporting and
accounting requirements and should have sought prior FERC approval of the
lease renewal. The complaint seeks various forms of relief from the FERC. The
complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they
were recorded in allegedly non-formula accounts or, alternatively, the
disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years
plus interest. The complaint also asks that the FERC disallow and refund the
lease costs of the sale-leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence,
investigate System Energy’s treatment of a DOE litigation payment, and impose
certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for
retail regulators of the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rates. The APSC,
MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding.

  

In June 2018, System Energy and Entergy Services filed a motion to dismiss and
an answer to the LPSC complaint denying that System Energy’s treatment of the
sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed
rate or any other FERC ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or
otherwise constituted double recovery. The response also argued that the
complaint is inconsistent with a FERC-approved settlement to which the LPSC is
a party and that explicitly authorizes System Energy to recover its lease
payments. Finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the
sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the LPSC complaint fails
to justify any disallowance or refunds. The response also offered to submit
formula rate protocols for the Unit Power Sales Agreement similar to the
procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the MISO tariff. In
September 2018 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and
settlement proceedings. The FERC established a refund effective date of May
18, 2018.

  

In February 2019 the presiding ALJ ruled that the hearing ordered by the FERC
includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred
income tax should be included in, or excluded from, System Energy’s formula
rate. In March 2019 the LPSC, MPSC, APSC and City Council filed direct
testimony. The LPSC testimony sought refunds that include the renewal lease
payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since July 2015), rate base
reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax
positions, and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-
leaseback interest, as well as interest on those amounts.

In June 2019 System Energy filed answering testimony arguing that the FERC
should reject all claims for refunds. Among other things, System Energy argued
that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital
additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent
with the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate, System Energy was not over
or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save costs over the
initial and renewal terms of the leases. System Energy argued that claims for
refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions
should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital,
the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the
underlying tax positions is uncertain. System Energy’s testimony also
challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties.

  

In August 2019 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony
seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The FERC trial staff also argued that System Energy
recovered $32 million more than it should have in depreciation expense for
capital additions. In September 2019, System Energy filed cross-answering
testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s arguments for refunds, stating that
the FERC trial staff’s position regarding depreciation rates for capital
additions is not unreasonable, but explaining that any change in depreciation
expense is only one element of a Unit Power Sales Agreement re-billing
calculation. Adjustments to depreciation expense in any re-billing under the
Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to
accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula
elements as needed. In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony
increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The LPSC seeks approximately $512 million plus
interest, which is approximately $191 million through December 31, 2020. The
FERC trial staff also filed rebuttal testimony in which it seeks refunds of a
similar amount as the LPSC for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions. The LPSC testimony also argued that adjustments to depreciation
rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only.

  

A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ
issued an initial decision. Among other things, the ALJ determined that
refunds were due on three main issues. First, with regard to the lease renewal
payments, the ALJ determined that System Energy is recovering an unjust
acquisition premium through the lease renewal payments, and that System
Energy’s recovery from customers through rates should be limited to the cost
of service based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, which
is approximately $70 million. The ALJ found that the remedy for this issue
should be the refund of lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year
since July 2015) with interest determined at the FERC quarterly interest rate,
which would be offset by the addition of the net book value of the leased
assets in the cost of service. The ALJ did not calculate a value for the
refund expected as a result of this remedy. In addition, System Energy would
no longer recover the lease payments in rates prospectively. Second, with
regard to the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, the ALJ
determined that the liabilities are accumulated deferred income taxes and
System Energy’s rate base should have been reduced for those liabilities. If
the ALJ’s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this issue
through December 31, 2020, is approximately $422 million, plus interest, which
is approximately $110 million through December 31, 2020. The ALJ also found
that System Energy should include liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions as a rate base reduction going forward. Third, with regard to the
depreciation expense adjustments, the ALJ found that System Energy should
correct for the error in re-billings retroactively and prospectively, but that
System Energy should not be permitted to recover interest on any retroactive
return on enhanced rate base resulting from such corrections. If the initial
decision is affirmed on this issue, System Energy estimates refunds of
approximately $19 million, which includes interest through December 31, 2020.

  

The ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process,
and an ALJ’s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on
the FERC. The ALJ in the initial decision acknowledges that these are issues
of first impression before the FERC. In June 2020, System Energy, the LPSC,
and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions, challenging several of
the initial decision’s findings. System Energy’s brief on exceptions
challenged the initial decision’s limitations on recovery of the lease renewal
payments, its proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions, and its proposal to asymmetrically treat interest on
bill corrections for depreciation expense adjustments. The LPSC’s and the FERC
trial staff’s briefs on

exceptions each challenged the initial decision’s allowance for recovery of
the cost of service associated with the lease renewal based on the remaining
net book value of the leased assets, its calculation of the remaining net book
value of the leased assets, and the amount of the initial decision’s proposed
rate base refund for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.
The LPSC’s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision’s proposal
that depreciation expense adjustments include retroactive adjustments to rate
base and its finding that section 203 of the Federal Power Act did not apply
to the lease renewal. The FERC trial staff’s brief on exceptions also
challenged the initial decision’s finding that the FERC need not institute a
formal investigation into System Energy’s tariff. In October 2020, System
Energy, the LPSC, the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed briefs
opposing exceptions. System Energy opposed the exceptions filed by the LPSC
and the FERC trial staff. The LPSC, MPSC, APSC, City Council, and the FERC
trial staff opposed the exceptions filed by System Energy. Also in October
2020 the MPSC, APSC, and the City Council filed briefs adopting the exceptions
of the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The case is pending before the FERC,
which will review the case and issue an order on the proceeding, and the FERC
may accept, reject, or modify the ALJ’s initial decision in whole or in part.
Refunds, if any, that might be required will only become due after the FERC
issues its order reviewing the initial decision.

  

In addition, in September 2020, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment
(NOPA) and Entergy executed it. The NOPA memorializes the IRS’s decision to
adjust the 2015 consolidated federal income tax return of Entergy Corporation
and certain of its subsidiaries, including System Energy, with regard to the
uncertain decommissioning tax position. Pursuant to the audit resolution
documented in the NOPA, the IRS allowed System Energy’s inclusion of $102
million of future nuclear decommissioning costs in System Energy’s cost of
goods sold for the 2015 tax year, roughly 10% of the requested deduction, but
disallowed the balance of the position. In September 2020, System Energy filed
a motion to lodge the NOPA into the record in the FERC proceeding. In October
2020 the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff
filed oppositions to System Energy’s motion. As a result of the NOPA issued by
the IRS in September 2020, System Energy filed, in October 2020, a new Federal
Power Act section 205 filing at FERC to establish an ongoing rate base credit
for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning
uncertain tax position. On a prospective basis beginning with the October 2020
bill, System Energy proposes to include the accumulated deferred income taxes
arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax
position as a credit to rate base under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In
November 2020 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the
filing, and System Energy responded.

  

In November 2020 the IRS issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) for the
2014/2015 tax year and in December 2020 Entergy executed it. The RAR contained
the same adjustment to the uncertain nuclear decommissioning tax position as
that which the IRS had announced in the NOPA. In December 2020, System Energy
filed a motion to lodge the RAR into the record in the FERC proceeding
addressing the uncertain tax position rate base issue. In January 2021 the
LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the motion.

  

As a result of the RAR, in December 2020, System Energy filed amendments to
its new Federal Power Act section 205 filings to establish an ongoing rate
base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the
decommissioning uncertain tax position and to credit excess accumulated
deferred income taxes arising from the successful portion of the
decommissioning uncertain tax position. The amendments both propose the
inclusion of the RAR as support for the filings. In December 2020 the LPSC,
APSC, and City Council filed a protest in response to the amendments,
reiterating their prior objections to the filings. In February 2021 the FERC
issued an order accepting System Energy’s Federal Power Act section 205
filings subject to refund, setting them for hearing, and holding the hearing
in abeyance.

  

In December 2020, System Energy filed a new Federal Power Act section 205
filing to provide a one-time, historical credit of $25.2 million for the
accumulated deferred income taxes that would have been created by the
decommissioning uncertain tax position if the IRS’s decision had been known in
2016. In January 2021 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest
to the filing.

LPSC Authorization of Additional Complaints

  

In May 2020 the LPSC authorized its staff to file additional complaints at the
FERC related to the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf energy and
capacity supplied to Entergy Louisiana under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.
The LPSC directive notes that the initial decision issued by the presiding ALJ
in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback complaint proceeding did not address, for
procedural reasons, certain rate issues raised by the LPSC and declined to
order further investigation of rates charged by System Energy. The LPSC
directive authorizes its staff to file complaints at the FERC “necessary to
address these rate issues, to request a full investigation into the rates
charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf power, and to seek rate refund, rate
reduction, and such other remedies as may be necessary and appropriate to
protect Louisiana ratepayers.” The LPSC directive further stated that the LPSC
has seen “information suggesting that the Grand Gulf plant has been
significantly underperforming compared to other nuclear plants in the United
States, has had several extended and unexplained outages, and has been plagued
with serious safety concerns.” The LPSC expressed concern that the costs paid
by Entergy Louisiana's retail customers may have been detrimentally impacted,
and authorized “the filing of a FERC complaint to address these performance
issues and to seek appropriate refund, rate reduction, and other remedies as
may be appropriate.”

  

The first of the additional complaints was filed at the FERC by the LPSC, the
APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council in September 2020. The new complaint
raises two sets of rate allegations: violations of the filed rate and a
corresponding request for refunds for prior periods; and elements of the Unit
Power Sales Agreement are unjust and unreasonable and a corresponding request
for refunds for the 15-month refund period and changes to the Unit Power Sales
Agreement prospectively. Several of the filed rate allegations overlap with
the previous complaints. The filed rate allegations not previously raised are
that System Energy: failed to provide a rate base credit to customers for the
“time value” of sale-leaseback lease payments collected from customers in
advance of the time those payments were due to the owner-lessors; improperly
included certain lease refinancing costs in rate base as prepayments;
improperly included nuclear decommissioning outage costs in rate base; failed
to include categories of accumulated deferred income taxes as a reduction to
rate base; charged customers based on a higher equity ratio than would be
appropriate due to excessive retained earnings; and did not correctly reflect
money pool investments and imprudently invested cash into the money pool. The
elements of the Unit Power Sales Agreement that the complaint alleges are
unjust and unreasonable include: incentive and executive compensation, lack of
an equity re-opener, lobbying, and private airplane travel. The new complaint
also requests a rate investigation into the Unit Power Sales Agreement and
System Energy’s billing practices pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power
Act, including any issue relevant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its
inputs. System Energy filed its answer opposing the new complaint in November
2020. In its answer, System Energy argued that all of the claims raised in the
complaint should be dismissed and agreed that bill adjustment with respect to
two discrete issues were justified. System Energy argued that dismissal is
warranted because all claims fall into one or more of the following
categories: the claims have been raised and are being litigated in another
proceeding; the claims do not present a prima facie case and do not satisfy
the threshold burden to establish a complaint proceeding; the claims are
premised on a theory or request relief that is incompatible with federal law
or FERC policy; the claims request relief that is inconsistent with the filed
rate; the claims are barred or waived by the legal doctrine of laches; and/or
the claims have been fully addressed and do not warrant further litigation.
In December 2020, System Energy filed a bill adjustment report indicating that
$3.4 million had been credited to customers in connection with the two
discrete issues concerning the inclusion of certain accumulated deferred
income taxes balances in rates. In January 2021 the complainants filed a
response to System Energy’s November 2020 answer, and in February 2020, System
Energy filed a response to the complainant’s response.

  

The operational prudence-related complaint has not been filed as of this date,
and the LPSC directive did not set a date for the filing.

  

Unit Power Sales Agreement

  

In August 2017, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the
Unit Power Sales

441

* * *

System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and
energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans. The filing proposes limited amendments to the Unit Power
Sales Agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in calculating Grand Gulf
plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2) updated nuclear
decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of which are recovered
through the Unit Power Sales Agreement rate formula. The amendments result in
lower charges to the Utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy
from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The changes were
based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning studies that take
into account the renewal of Grand Gulf’s operating license for a term through
November 1, 2044.

  

In September 2017 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed Unit Power Sales
Agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness
and reasonableness of the amendments. Because the amendments propose a rate
decrease, the FERC also initiated an investigation under section 206 of the
Federal Power Act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than
proposed. The FERC accepted the proposed amendments effective October 1, 2017,
subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing
proceedings, and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2017 with
respect to the rate decrease. In June 2018, System Energy filed with the FERC
an uncontested settlement relating to the updated depreciation rates and
nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements. In August 2018 the
FERC issued an order accepting the settlement. In the third quarter 2018,
System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately
$26 million, representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense
resulting from the depreciation rates used from October 11, 2017 through
September 30, 2018 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement
filing accepted by the FERC.

  

Nuclear Matters

  

System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates Grand Gulf. System
Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a
nuclear plant. These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling
and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the
substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and
operational needs, to position Grand Gulf to meet its operational goals; the
performance and capacity factors of Grand Gulf, including the financial
requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of
certain materials within the plant systems; regulatory requirements and
potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the
regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and
amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent
sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the
fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning
trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of the site when
required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially
available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and
catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. In the event of an
unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to
provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements
for decommissioning. Grand Gulf’s operating license expires in 2044.

  

In November 2020 the NRC placed Grand Gulf in the “regulatory response
column”, or Column 2, of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix
based on the incidence of three unplanned plant scrams during the second and
third quarters of 2020. Two of the scram events related to new turbine control
system components that failed, and a third related to a feedwater valve
positioner that failed, all of which had been replaced in a refueling outage
that ended in May 2020. The NRC plans to conduct a supplemental inspection of
Grand Gulf in accordance with its inspection procedures for nuclear plants in
Column 2. As a consequence of two additional Grand Gulf scrams during the
fourth quarter 2020, System Energy expects Grand Gulf to be placed into the
“degraded cornerstone column”, or Column 3, of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight
Process Action Matrix based on plant performance indicators for the four
quarters ended December 31, 2020. This will involve an additional supplemental
NRC inspection of Grand Gulf in accordance with its inspection procedures for
nuclear plants in Column 3.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

  

Environmental Risks

  

System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other
environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in
“Regulation of Entergy’s Business \- Environmental Regulation” in Part I, Item
1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance
costs cannot be precisely estimated.

  

Critical Accounting Estimates

  

The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
System Energy’s financial position or results of operations.

  

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions

  

See “Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions” in the “Critical Accounting
Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.

  

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

  

System Energy’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as
described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous
factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics,
and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.
See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in the “Critical
Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s
estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

including $105 thousand in settlement costs. System Energy anticipates 2021
qualified pension cost to be $20 million. System Energy contributed $16.1
million to its qualified pension plans in 2020 and estimates 2021 pension
contributions will approximate $18.7 million, although the 2021 required
pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1,
2021 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2021.

  

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for System
Energy in 2020 was $1.5 million. System Energy expects 2021 postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $1.3 million.
System Energy contributed $1.3 million to its other postretirement plans in
2020 and expects 2021 contributions to approximate $22 thousand.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

  

To the shareholder and Board of Directors of

System Energy Resources, Inc.

  

Opinion on the Financial Statements

  

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of System Energy Resources,
Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements
of income, cash flows, and changes in common equity (pages 447 through 452 and
applicable items in pages 51 through 238), for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

  

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  

Critical Audit Matter

  

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that is material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on
the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

  

Rate and Regulatory Matters —System Energy Resources, Inc. — Refer to Notes 2
to the financial statements

  

Critical Audit Matter Description

  

The Company is subject to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized
rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for
the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line
items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory
assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense;
income taxes; and depreciation and amortization expense.

Table of Contents

  

The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and
annual earnings oversight. Because the FERC sets the rates the Company is
allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable
return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the
financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the
recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether
the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria
for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when
regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate
orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as
changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company
has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated
rates, there is a risk that the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of
the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts
invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.

  

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to
the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about
impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity
involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the (1) likelihood of
recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) likelihood of refunds to
customers, and (3) ongoing complaints filed with the FERC against the Company.
Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by
the FERC, involved especially subjective judgment and specialized knowledge of
accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process.

  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

  

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the
FERC included the following, among others:

  

•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of
the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as
property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a
refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory
liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over
the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment;
regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in
future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate
regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC for the Company and
other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural
memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available
information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a
future reduction in rates based on precedents of the FERC’s treatment of
similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external
information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and
liability balances for completeness.

•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings and
ongoing complaints filed with the FERC, including the Return on Equity,
Capital Structure, and Grand Gulf Sale-Leaseback Renewal complaints, and
considered the filings with the FERC by intervenors that may impact the
Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s
assertions.

•We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and
external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for
regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory
liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, including the complaints
filed with the FERC against the Company, to assess management’s assertion that
amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

In accordance with Entergy’s stock-based compensation plans, Entergy
periodically grants stock options to key employees, which may be exercised to
obtain shares of Entergy’s common stock. According to the plans, these shares
can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open
market. Entergy’s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on
the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of
grants under the plans. In addition to this authority, the Board has
authorized share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in
response to market conditions. In October 2010 the Board granted authority for
a $500 million share repurchase program. The amount of share repurchases under
these programs may vary as a result of material changes in business results or
capital spending or new investment opportunities. In addition, in the first
quarter 2020, Entergy withheld 151,159 shares of its common stock at $126.31
per share, 79,153 shares of its common stock at $129.55 per share, 41,167
shares of its common stock at $131.52 per share, 2,269 shares of its common
stock at $124.28 per share, 1,331 shares of its common stock at $123.74 per
share, 1,088 shares of its common stock at $102.93 per share, 441 shares of
its common stock at $132.19 per share, 71 shares of its common stock at $86.51
per share, 31 shares of its common stock at $115.90 per share, and 19 shares
of its common stock at $86.74 per share to pay income taxes due upon vesting
of restricted stock granted and payout of performance units as part of its
long-term incentive program.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

  

As of December 31, 2020, evaluations were performed under the supervision and
with the participation of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy (individually “Registrant” and collectively the “Registrants”)
management, including their respective Principal Executive Officers (PEO) and
Principal Financial Officers (PFO). The evaluations assessed the effectiveness
of the Registrants’ disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluations, each PEO and PFO has concluded that, as to the Registrant or
Registrants for which they serve as PEO or PFO, the Registrant’s or
Registrants’ disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and that the Registrant’s
or Registrants’ disclosure controls and procedures are also effective in
reasonably assuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Registrant’s or Registrants’ management, including their respective PEOs
and PFOs, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Texas, and System Energy)

  

The managements of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy
(individually “Registrant” and collectively the “Registrants”) are responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting for the Registrants. Each Registrant’s internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of each Registrant’s financial statements presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

  

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

  

Each Registrant’s management assessed the effectiveness of each Registrant’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making
this assessment, each Registrant’s management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework. The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized
for management’s assessment.

  

Based on each management’s assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013
COSO Framework, each Registrant’s management believes that each Registrant
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2020.

  

The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Entergy Corporation’s independent
registered public accounting firm, regarding Entergy Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting is included herein. The report of Deloitte &
Touche LLP is not applicable to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy because
these Registrants are non-accelerated filers.

  

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

  

Under the supervision and with the participation of each Registrant’s
management, including its respective PEO and PFO, each Registrant evaluated
changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
quarter ended December 31, 2020 and found no change that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over
financial reporting.

Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm

  

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

  

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2020,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by COSO.

  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Corporation
and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

  

Basis for Opinion

  

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A, Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2021 Executive Compensation Program Enhancements

  

Annual Incentive Awards. Feedback from Entergy Corporation’s investors has
indicated that environmental, social and governance (or ESG) issues are being
viewed as increasingly vital to long-term performance. In addition, investors
are expecting more transparency regarding corporate ESG commitments. This
echoes Entergy Corporation’s own commitment to ESG and all of its critical
stakeholders. Thus, Entergy Corporation conducted a comprehensive review of
its incentive program in 2020 to identify and prioritize the optimal incentive
metrics – including ESG goals – to use in the 2021 program. Historically,
Entergy Corporation has used two financial measures to determine the Entergy
Achievement Multiplier (“EAM”), which is the performance metric used to
determine the maximum funding available for annual incentive awards. ESG and
other performance metrics were considered in determining the allocation of
incentive funds to certain workgroups and individual recipients. However, to
demonstrate Entergy Corporation’s strong commitment to its ESG goals, and to
more explicitly link compensation to the interests of its stakeholders, the
EAM will be determined based on financial and non-financial measures beginning
in 2021. Specifically, a financial measure will be weighted 60%, while
quantitative and qualitative non-financial measures, including ESG metrics,
will account for the remaining 40%.

  

Financial Measure: Keeping with the committee’s goal of aligning performance
measures with financial results that link to externally communicated investor
guidance, ETR Tax Adjusted earnings per share or ETR Tax Adjusted EPS will
continue to be used as the financial measure to determine 60% of the EAM. ETR
Tax Adjusted EPS is based on Entergy’s Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“ETR
Adjusted EPS”), which is the earnings measure that is used for external
guidance. ETR Adjusted EPS adjusts Entergy Corporation’s as reported (GAAP)
earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its Entergy Wholesale
Commodities business, significant tax items and other non-routine items. To
arrive at ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, ETR Adjusted EPS is adjusted to add back the
effect of significant tax items, and to eliminate the effect of: (i) major
storms, including the impact on total debt of pending securitizations, (ii)
the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, (iii)
unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (iv) potential effects of
federal income tax law changes, and (v) elective contributions to pension
plans or trusts related to non-qualified postretirement benefits that deviate
from original plan assumptions.

Non-Financial Measures: The following non-financial metrics will be used to
determine 40% of the EAM for 2021:

customer outcomes (as measured through customer feedback) including impacts on
reliability improvements, responsiveness, continuous improvement and

•Signals overall health and loyalty of Entergy Corporation’s customer
relationship.  
  
  

Targets for each of the non-financial measures will be clearly defined and
will be designed to drive employee behaviors that support all four of Entergy
Corporation’s stakeholders – customers, employees, communities and our owners.

  

Long-Term Performance Incentive Program (“LTIP”). In recent performance
periods, Entergy Corporation has used two financial measures to determine
awards under the LTIP – a cumulative earnings per share (EPS) measure (most
recently cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS) and relative total shareholder return
(“TSR”). To emphasize the importance of strong cash generation for the long-
term health of its business, Entergy Corporation is replacing the EPS measure
with a credit measure – adjusted FFO/Debt ratio for the 2021 – 2023
performance period. The adjusted FFO/Debt ratio is the ratio of: (i) adjusted
funds from operations calculated as operating cash flow adjusted for allowance
for funds used during construction, working capital and the effects of
securitization revenue, and the pre-defined exclusions discussed above for the
annual incentives; to (ii) total debt, excluding outstanding or pending
securitization debt. The Personnel Committee decided to use this ratio because
it emphasizes financial stability, noting that a financially healthy utility
creates the capacity to make investments on behalf of customers, addresses the
needs of communities, provides low-cost access to capital markets and promotes
employee confidence. Relative TSR will continue to be used as the other
performance measure for the 2021 – 2023 LTIP performance period, with relative
TSR weighted 80% and the credit measure weighted 20%. Relative TSR measures
Entergy Corporation’s total TSR relative to the TSR of the companies in the
Philadelphia Utility Index as of December 31, 2020. Targets for the LTIP
performance measures will include the same exclusions that will be used to
determine the annual incentive financial measure targets.

  

2020 Incentive Payouts

  

Performance measures and targets for the 2020 annual incentive awards were
determined by the Personnel Committee in January 2020 and the targets and
measures for the 2018 – 2020 LTIP performance cycle were

470

* * *

Table of Contents

established in January 2018. In January 2021, the Personnel Committee
certified the results for the EAM for the 2020 annual incentive awards and the
2018 – 2020 LTIP performance cycle. The Personnel Committee did not make any
adjustments to the targets for either program for the impact of COVID-19 on
Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.

  

Entergy Corporation believes the 2020 incentive pay outcomes for the NEOs
demonstrate the application of its pay for performance philosophy.

  

Annual Incentive Awards

  

The Personnel Committee determined that the 2020 EAM would be based on two
equally weighted performance metrics:

  

•ETR Tax Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“ETR Tax Adjusted EPS”): Entergy
Corporation uses a single non-GAAP earnings measure for guidance and investor
reporting purposes that reflects its ongoing business. This measure, Entergy
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“ETR Adjusted EPS”) adjusts Entergy Corporation’s
as reported (GAAP) earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its
Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, significant tax items and other non-
routine items. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on the externally reported ETR
Adjusted EPS, which is then adjusted to add back the effect of significant tax
items, and to eliminate the effect of major storms, the resolution of certain
unresolved regulatory litigation matters, changes in federal income tax law
and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities (the “Pre-Determined
Exclusions”), as well as other items the Personnel Committee may consider
appropriate adjustments based on management accountability and business
rationale.

  

•Entergy Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (“ETR Adjusted OCF”): ETR Adjusted OCF
is calculated based on Entergy Corporation’s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash
flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Pre-Determined Exclusions.

  

The 2020 annual incentive award targets and results determined by the
Personnel Committee were:

  

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Annual Incentive Program Performance Goals | 2020 Targets | 2020 Results |  |  |  |  |  | |
|ETR Tax Adjusted EPS | $5.60 | $6.90 |  |  |  |  |  | |
|ETR Adjusted OCF ($ billions) | $3.450 | $3.127 |  |  |  |  |  | |
|EAM as a percentage of target | 100% | 120% |  |  |  |  |  | |
|Average NEO Payout (as a percentage of target) |  | 124% |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

In January 2021, the Personnel Committee determined that ETR Adjusted EPS
exceeded the maximum by $1.30, but fell short of achieving its ETR Adjusted
OCF target of $3.45 billion by approximately $323 million, leading to a
preliminary EAM of 118%. In recognition of management’s success in achieving
positive outcomes in 2020 on certain strategic efforts deemed critical to
Entergy Corporation’s long-term success, the committee exercised its
discretion to increase the EAM by 2% to 120%. Based on each NEO’s individual
accountabilities and accomplishments, the committee then determined individual
annual incentive awards of 115% to 150% of the target opportunity for each of
the NEOs.

  

Long-Term Performance Unit Program

  

In January 2018, the Personnel Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative
Adjusted Utility, Plant & Other Earnings Per Share (“Cumulative Adjusted UP&O
EPS”), each weighted equally, as the performance measures for the 2018 – 2020
LTIP performance period. Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS adjusts Entergy
Corporation’s cumulative operational Utility, Parent & Other results to
eliminate the impact of tax items and weather. Similar to the way targets are
established for the annual incentive awards, the relative TSR and Cumulative
Adjusted UP&O EPS performance measures were established by the Personnel
Committee after the Board’s review of Entergy Corporation’s strategic plan.

Competitive Positioning

  

Market Data for Compensation Comparison

  

Annually, the Personnel Committee reviews:

  

•Published and private compensation survey data compiled by Pay Governance,
the Personnel Committee’s independent compensation consultant;

472

* * *

Table of Contents

•Both utility and general industry data to determine total cash compensation
(base salary and annual incentive) for non-industry specific roles;

•Data from utility companies to determine total cash compensation for
management roles that are utility-specific, such as Group President, Utility
Operations; and

•Utility market data to determine long-term incentives for all positions.

  

How the Personnel Committee Uses the Market Data

  

The Personnel Committee uses this survey data to develop compensation
opportunities that are designed to deliver total direct compensation (“TDC”)
within a targeted range of approximately the 50th percentile of the surveyed
companies in the aggregate. In most cases, the committee considers its
objectives to have been met if Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer
and the eight other executive officers (including the applicable NEOs) who
constitute the OCE each has a target compensation opportunity that falls
within a targeted range of 85% - 115% of the 50th percentile of the survey
data. In general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a
position tend to be at the lower end of the competitive range, while seasoned
executive officers whose experience and skill set are viewed as critical to
retain would be positioned at the higher end of the competitive range.
Generally, differences in the levels of TDC among the NEOs are primarily
driven by the scope of their responsibilities, differences in the competitive
market pay range for similar positions, performance and considerations of
internal pay equity.

  

Proxy Peer Group

  

Although the survey data described above are the primary data used in
benchmarking compensation, the committee uses compensation information from
the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index to evaluate the
overall reasonableness of Entergy Corporation’s compensation programs and to
determine relative TSR for the 2020 - 2022 LTIP performance period. The
companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index at the time the Personnel
Committee approved the 2020 compensation model and framework were:

  

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

2020 Compensation Decisions

  

Base Salary

  

When setting the base salaries of the NEOs who are members of the OCE, the
Personnel Committee generally targets the range of compensation paid to
similarly situated executive officers of the companies included in the market
data previously discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis under
“Competitive Positioning.” For the other NEOs, their salaries are established
by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. The base salaries of
the NEOs are considered annually as part of the performance review process,
and upon a NEO’s promotion or other change in job responsibilities. Based on
this review in 2020 and after reviewing the market data above, all of the
NEOs, other than Mr. Denault, received increases in their base salaries
ranging from approximately 2.5% to 6.15%. In 2020, Mr. Denault did not receive
an increase in his base salary. Instead, the

473

Table of Contents

Personnel Committee increased Mr. Denault’s TDC by increasing his long-term
incentive target opportunities; thereby, increasing the portion of his
compensation that is “at risk” and further aligning his interests with those
of Entergy Corporation’s shareholders.

  

The following table sets forth the 2019 and 2020 base salaries for the Named
Executive Officers. Changes in base salaries for 2020 were effective in April.

Annual Incentive Compensation

  

In 2020, annual incentive awards were tied to Entergy Corporation’s financial
and operational performance through the EAM. Entergy Corporation uses the
following process to determine annual incentive awards:

  

•Establish Performance Measures to Determine EAM Pool. Annually, the Personnel
Committee engages in a rigorous process to determine the performance measures
used to determine the EAM. The Personnel Committee’s goal is to establish
measures that are consistent with Entergy Corporation’s strategy and business
objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its strategic plan, and are
designed to drive results that represent a high level of achievement. These
measures are approved based on a comprehensive review of Entergy Corporation’s
strategic plan by its full Board of Directors conducted in December of the
preceding year and updated in January to reflect key drivers of anticipated
changes in performance from the preceding year.

  

•Establish Target Achievement Levels. In January, after Entergy Corporation’s
strategic plan is updated to reflect any changes from that reviewed in
December, the Personnel Committee establishes the specific targets that must
be achieved for each performance measure. The Personnel Committee also seeks
to assure that the targets:

  

◦Take into account changes in the business environment and specific challenges
facing Entergy Corporation;

◦Reflect an appropriate balancing of the various risks and opportunities
recognized at the time the targets are set; and

◦Are aligned with external expectations communicated to Entergy Corporation’s
shareholders.

  

•Establish NEO Target Opportunities. In January of each year, the Personnel
Committee establishes the target opportunities for the members of the OCE
based on its review of the competitive analysis of job-specific market data
prepared by Pay Governance as well as the officer’s role, individual
performance and internal equity considerations. For the NEOs who are members
of the OCE (Messrs. Bakken, Brown, Denault, Marsh and West), target award
opportunities are established based on these factors. For the other NEOs,
target award opportunities are determined based on their management level
within the Entergy organization. Executive management levels at Entergy
Corporation range from ML level 1 through ML level 4 (the “ML 1-4 Officers”).
At December 31, 2020, Mr. May held a Level 3 position, and Mr. Ellis,

474

* * *

Table of Contents

Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux and Ms. Rainer held Level 4 positions.
Accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one
another based on either their management level or the external market data
developed by the Committee’s independent compensation consultant. The 2020
target opportunities were increased for Mr. Bakken, Mr. Brown, Mr. Marsh and
Mr. West to align more closely with market data and internal pay equity. Mr.
Denault’s 2020 target opportunity was unchanged from the level set in 2019 due
to the Personnel Committee’s decision to increase his TDC by increasing his
long-term incentive target opportunities.  The target levels for the other
NEOs are comparable to the levels set for 2019.

  

•Determine the EAM. In January, after the end of the fiscal year, the Finance
and Personnel Committees jointly review Entergy Corporation’s financial
results and the Personnel Committee determines the EAM, which represents the
level of success in achieving the performance objectives established by the
committee and determines the maximum funding level of the annual incentive
plan, as a percentage of the total target opportunity.

  

•Determine Annual Incentive Awards. To determine individual executive officer
awards under the annual incentive plan, the Personnel Committee considers not
only each executive’s role in executing on Entergy Corporation’s strategies
and delivering the financial performance achieved, but also the individual’s
accountability for any challenges Entergy Corporation experienced during the
year.

  

Establishing 2020 Financial Measures and Targets

  

Using the process described above, in December 2019, the Personnel Committee
decided to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF, with each measure
weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the 2020 EAM
pool. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on ETR Adjusted EPS, which is the primary
earnings measure used by Entergy Corporation externally and the measure on
which it provides annual earnings guidance. To arrive at ETR Tax Adjusted EPS,
ETR Adjusted EPS is adjusted to add back the effect of any significant tax
items that were excluded to arrive at ETR Adjusted EPS and to eliminate the
effects, if any, of the Pre-Determined Exclusions. ETR Adjusted OCF is
calculated based on Entergy Corporation’s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash
flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any significant non-routine items
not representative of the ongoing business, such as items associated with the
decisions to sell or close the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants,
and any Pre-Determined Exclusions. The Personnel Committee determined that ETR
Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF were the appropriate metrics to use for
annual incentives in 2020 because:

  

•They are based on objective financial measures that Entergy Corporation and
its investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial
performance;

•They are based on the same metrics we use for internal and external financial
reporting; and

•They provide both discipline and transparency.

  

The Personnel Committee considered it appropriate to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS,
which adds back the effect of significant tax items that may have been
excluded from ETR Adjusted EPS, as the earnings measure because of the
significant financial benefits to Entergy Corporation resulting from such tax
items and the management effort required to achieve them. The Personnel
Committee also considered the appropriateness of excluding the effect of each
of the specific Pre-Determined Exclusions it had identified from each of the
financial measures. It viewed the exclusion of major storms as appropriate
because although Entergy Corporation includes estimates for storm costs in its
financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as
a hurricane. The Personnel Committee considered the exclusion of any
unanticipated effects of the tax reform legislation adopted at the end of 2017
to be appropriate because of the lingering uncertainty around those effects
and the inability of management to impact those results. The Personnel
Committee approved the other exclusions from reported results - for the impact
of certain legacy unresolved regulatory litigation and unanticipated
unrealized gains and losses on securities held by Entergy Corporation’s
nuclear decommissioning trusts - primarily because of management’s inability
to influence either of the related outcomes. The Personnel Committee further
provided that in determining the 2020 EAM, the 2020 results would be subject
to adjustment for other items the committee may consider appropriate in its
review of 2020 performance, considering management accountability and business

rationale, and the EAM as so calculated would be subject to further adjustment
at the committee’s discretion based on business considerations.

  

In determining the targets to set for 2020, the Personnel Committee reviewed
anticipated drivers and risks to Entergy Corporation’s expectations for its
adjusted earnings and operating cash flow for 2020 as set forth in its
financial plan, as well as factors driving the strong financial performance
achieved in 2019. The Personnel Committee confirmed that the proposed plan
targets for ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF reflected significant
growth in the core earnings and consolidated operating cash flow measures
underlying the annual incentive plan targets. The Personnel Committee also
noted that while the 2020 ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target was less than the 2019
results, the 2020 target represented significant growth in the underlying ETR
Adjusted EPS both from 2019 results and from the 2019 target, with the primary
driver of the higher results in 2019 being certain one-time tax benefits that
would not be recurring in 2020. The Personnel Committee also considered the
potential impact of a wide range of identified risks and opportunities and
confirmed that the related annual incentive plan targets reflected a
reasonable balancing of such risks and opportunities and an appropriate degree
of challenge.

  

2020 Performance Assessment

  

The following table shows the 2020 annual incentive plan performance metrics
and targets established by the Personnel Committee to determine the 2020 EAM
and 2020 results:

In January 2021, the Finance and Personnel Committees jointly reviewed Entergy
Corporation’s financial results against the performance objectives reflected
in the table above. Management discussed with the committees Entergy
Corporation’s ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and the ETR Adjusted OCF results for 2020,
including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2020
business plan and annual incentive plan targets set in January 2020. ETR Tax
Adjusted EPS exceeded the ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target of $5.60 per share by
$1.30, but management fell short of achieving its ETR Adjusted OCF target of
$3.45 billion by approximately $323 million, leading to a preliminary EAM of
118%. These results reflected a positive adjustment of $0.10 to ETR Tax
Adjusted EPS and a positive adjustment of $274 million to ETR Adjusted OCF for
the effects on earnings and operational cash flow of major storms impacting
Entergy Corporation’s service area during 2020, consistent with the Pre-
Determined Exclusions approved when the targets were set at the beginning of
the year. The results also reflected a positive adjustment of $100 million to
ETR Adjusted OCF for the effect on operational cash flow of additional
voluntary contributions made to Entergy Corporation’s pension plan in 2020
over and above the required level of contributions, which adjustment was made
because the committee did not consider it appropriate for management to be
penalized in the incentive compensation process for choosing to make such
elective contributions, consistent with the Pre-Determined Exclusion for items
the committee determined should be excluded based on management accountability
and business rationale.

  

The Personnel Committee considered whether 2020 ETR Tax Adjusted EPS or ETR
Adjusted OCF should be adjusted for any other factors that had impacted 2020
results. The committee noted that 2020 revenues and cash flow had been
adversely impacted by reduced sales resulting from unfavorable weather, the
COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, major storms, which collectively
reduced ETR Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.71 per share, and ETR Adjusted
OCF by approximately $663 million as compared to plan. In addition, the
Personnel Committee noted that ETR Adjusted OCF had been further reduced by
approximately $178 million due to increased customer arrearages as a result of
regulatory moratoria on customer disconnects following the onset of the
pandemic. As noted, both ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF were
adjusted to reflect the impact of

476

Table of Contents

major storms as a Pre-Determined Exclusion. However, the committee decided not
to adjust the results to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
disconnect moratoria or the unfavorable weather experienced in 2020.

  

In addition to the foregoing financial results, the Personnel Committee
considered management’s degree of success in achieving various operational and
regulatory goals set out at the beginning of the year and in overcoming
certain challenges that arose in the business during the course of the year.
The committee took note of not only the many ways management had created value
for all Entergy Corporation’s key stakeholders during 2020, but also the major
challenges that were overcome in the process, including the COVID-19 pandemic
and the challenges of responding to three hurricanes in a record-breaking
storm season for the Gulf Coast. The committee also noted that despite these
challenges, management had remained focused on achieving strong financial
results for the benefit of all of its stakeholders while at the same time
driving positive outcomes in certain areas that would contribute to Entergy
Corporation’s long term sustainability, including particularly the achievement
of its 2020 CO2 emissions goal, development and announcement of its goal to
achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and significant enhancements to its
sustainability disclosure and reporting, and substantial progress in other
important ESG and sustainability efforts. In recognition of these
accomplishments, which the committee considers to be critical to Entergy
Corporation’s long-term success, the committee exercised its discretion to
increase the EAM by 2% to 120%.

  

To determine individual NEO annual incentive awards for the NEOs who are
member of the OCE, the Personnel Committee considered individual performance
in executing on Entergy Corporation’s strategies and delivering the strong
financial performance achieved in 2020. In addition, the Personnel Committee
considered the individual’s key accountabilities and accomplishments in
relation to certain operational and regulatory challenges Entergy Corporation
experienced during the year. With these considerations in mind, the Personnel
Committee approved payouts ranging from 115% to 120% of target for each of the
NEOs who are members of the OCE.

  

After the EAM was established to determine overall funding for the annual
incentive awards, Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer allocated
incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit
results. Individual awards were determined for the remaining NEOs who are not
members of the OCE by their immediate supervisor based on the individual
officer’s key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. This
resulted in payouts that ranged from 117% of target to 150% of target for the
NEOs who are not members of the OCE.

  

Based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the Named
Executive Officers received the following annual incentive payouts for 2020:

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

  

Overview

  

Long-term incentive compensation, consisting solely of equity awards in 2020,
represents the largest portion of executive officer compensation, and as noted
earlier, the increase in Mr. Denault’s TDC opportunity was delivered in the
form of long-term incentive compensation. Entergy Corporation believes the
combination of long-term incentives it employs provides a compelling
performance-based compensation opportunity, acts in retaining the senior
management team, and aligns the interests of Entergy Corporation’s executive
officers with the interests of its shareholders and customers by enhancing
executives focus on Entergy Corporation’s long-term goals. In general, Entergy
Corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive
compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock
options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the
compensation model seeks to deliver.

  

For each NEO who is a member of the OCE, a dollar value is established to
determine that NEO’s long-term incentive awards target. The targeted award
value for each NEO is determined based on market median compensation data for
the officer’s role, adjusted to reflect individual performance and internal
equity. In January 2020, the Personnel Committee approved the 2020 long-term
incentive award target amounts for each NEO with each NEO’s target amount
increasing in recognition of the contributions made to Entergy Corporation in
2019. This target amount was then converted into the number of performance
units, stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to each NEO based
on the allocation described above.

  

In consultation with Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, the
Personnel Committee reviews each of the other NEO’s performance, role and
responsibilities, strengths, developmental opportunities and internal equity
and allocates awards of restricted stock and stock options to each of these
officers based on these factors. Grants of long-term performance units for
these NEOs were determined based on the average of the market data for the
officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer’s
specific job function, and allocated as described above.

  

2020 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix

  

Long-Term Performance Unit Program

  

The NEOs are issued performance unit awards under the LTIP.

  

•Each performance unit represents one share of Entergy Corporation’s common
stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued
during the performance period.

•The performance units and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the
performance period are settled in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock.

•The Personnel Committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the
outset of each performance period.

•No payout under this program will be made if relative TSR for the performance
period falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the
Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS is below the
minimum performance goal.

•All shares paid out under the LTIP are required to be retained by Entergy
Corporation’s officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements
are met.

  

The LTIP specifies a minimum, target and maximum achievement level, the
achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may
be earned by each participant. For the 2020 – 2022 LTIP performance period,
the Personnel Committee chose the performance measures and targets set forth
below.

Maximum (200%) - $19.63  
  
(1)Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using

Performance Measures

  

Relative TSR

  

•The Personnel Committee chose relative TSR as a performance measure because
it reflects Entergy Corporation’s creation of shareholder value relative to
other electric utilities included in the Philadelphia Utility Index over the
performance period. By measuring performance in relation to an industry
benchmark, this measure is intended to isolate and reward management for the
creation of shareholder value that is not driven by events that affect the
industry as a whole.

  

•Minimum, target and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to
the ranking of Entergy Corporation’s TSR in relation to the TSR of the
companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index. The Personnel Committee
identified the Philadelphia Utility Index as the appropriate industry peer
group for determining relative TSR because the companies included in this
index, in the aggregate, are deemed to be comparable to Entergy Corporation in
terms of business and scale.

  

Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS

  

•Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, which adjusts Entergy Corporation’s as reported
(GAAP) results to eliminate the impact of earnings or loss from Entergy
Wholesale Commodities and other non-routine items, was selected in 2020 as a
performance measure because the Personnel Committee wished to incentivize
management to achieve steady, predictable earnings growth for Entergy
Corporation over the 3 year performance period, and because it aligns with the
earnings measure used to communicate Entergy Corporation’s earnings
expectations externally to investors.

  

•In a manner similar to the way targets are established for the annual
incentives, targets for the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS performance measure
were established by the Personnel Committee after the Entergy Corporation
Board’s review of Entergy’s strategic plan for the three-year period beginning
in 2020 and are consistent with the earnings expectations for Entergy
Corporation that are communicated to investors. These targets also incorporate
the Pre-Determined Exclusions discussed previously with respect to the annual
incentive measures.

  

Stock Options and Restricted Stock

  

Entergy Corporation grants stock options and shares of restricted stock
because they align the interests of the executive officers with long-term
shareholder value, provide competitive compensation, and increase the
executives’ ownership in Entergy Corporation common stock. Generally, stock
options are granted with a maximum term of ten years, and vest one-third on
each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The exercise price
for each option granted in 2020 was $131.72, which was the closing price of
Entergy Corporation’s common stock on the date of grant. Shares of restricted
stock vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries

of the date of grant, are paid dividends which are reinvested in shares of
Entergy Corporation common stock and have full voting rights. The dividend
reinvestment shares are subject to forfeiture similar to the terms of the
original grant.

  

2020 Long-Term Incentive Awards

  

In January 2020, the Personnel Committee granted the following long-term
performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock to each NEO.
The number of long-term performance units, stock options and shares of
restricted stock were determined as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive
Compensation - Overview.”

Sallie T. Rainer | 950 | 4,300 | 750
Roderick K. West | 8,401 | 31,705 | 3,361
  
  

All of the performance units, shares of restricted stock and stock options
granted to the NEOs in 2020 were granted pursuant to the 2019 Omnibus
Incentive Plan or 2019 OIP. The 2019 OIP requires both a change in control and
an involuntary job loss without cause or a resignation by the NEO for good
reason within 24 months following a change in control (a “double trigger”) for
the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.

  

2020 LTIP Payouts

  

Payout for the 2018 – 2020 LTIP Performance Period. In January 2018, the
Personnel Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS as the
performance measures, each weighted equally, for the 2018 – 2020 LTIP
performance period. Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS, which adjusted Entergy
Corporation’s operational Utility, Parent & Other results to eliminate the
impact of tax items and weather (the “UP&O Adjustments”), was added as a
performance measure because it aligned with Entergy Corporation’s externally
communicated earnings measure on its core utility business and was the primary
measure on which Entergy Corporation communicated its long term earnings
outlooks in 2018. Similar to the way targets are established for the annual
incentive program, targets for the Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS performance
measure were established by the Personnel Committee after the Entergy
Corporation Board’s review of Entergy Corporation’s strategic plan. These
targets also exclude the Pre-Determined Exclusions discussed previously with
respect to the annual incentive measures, as well as the UP&O Adjustments. The
payout was determined based on the achievement of the following performance
goals established for both performance measures by the committee at the
beginning of the performance period:

In January 2021, the Personnel Committee reviewed Entergy Corporation’s TSR
and the Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS for the 2018 – 2020 LTIP performance
period in order to determine the payout to participants based upon the
performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2018 – 2020 LTIP
performance period as provided above. The committee compared Entergy
Corporation’s TSR against the TSR of the companies that were included in the
Philadelphia Utility Index throughout the three year performance period, which
were:

  

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|AES Corporation |  | Edison International |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |

|Duke Energy Corporation |  | Xcel Energy, Inc. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |
  
  

As recommended by the Finance Committee, the Personnel Committee concluded
that Entergy Corporation’s relative TSR for the 2018 – 2020 performance period
was in the second quartile, and that Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS was $15.25,
yielding a payout of 126% of target for the NEOs.

Executive Disability Plan | Eligible individuals who become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible for 65% of the difference between their annual base salary and $276,923 (i.e. the annual base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-term disability plan).   
  
  

Entergy Corporation provides these benefits to the NEOs as part of its effort
to provide a competitive executive compensation program and because it
believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools
since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent
provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.

Severance and Retention Arrangements

  

The Personnel Committee believes that retention and transitional compensation
arrangements are an important part of overall compensation as they help to
secure the continued employment and dedication of the NEOs, notwithstanding
any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding
their own continued employment. In addition, the Personnel Committee believes
that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as
many of the companies with which Entergy Corporation competes for executive
talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.

  

To achieve these objectives, Entergy Corporation has established a System
Executive Continuity Plan under which ML 1-4 Officers are entitled to receive
“change in control” payments and benefits if such officer’s employment is
involuntarily terminated without cause or if the officer resigns for good
reason, in each case, in connection with a change in control of Entergy
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation strives to ensure that
the benefits and payment levels under the System Executive Continuity Plan are
consistent with market practices. Entergy Corporation’s executive officers,
including the NEOs, are not entitled to any tax gross up payments on any
severance benefits received under this plan. For more information regarding
the System Executive Continuity Plan, see “2020 Potential Payments Upon
Termination or Change in Control.”

  

Nuclear Retention Plan

  

Mr. Bakken participates in the Nuclear Retention Plan, a retention plan for
officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. The
Personnel Committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management
and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique
technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry.
The plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year service
period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant’s management
level and continued employment. Each annual payment is equal to an amount
ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee’s base salary as of their date of
enrollment in the plan.

  

In recognition of the value Entergy Corporation places on Mr. Bakken as a
member of its senior management team and his extensive experience in the
nuclear industry, and to keep his pay competitive, in May 2019, Mr. Bakken’s
participation in the plan was renewed for another three-year period beginning
on May 1, 2019. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Nuclear
Retention Plan, in May 2020 Mr. Bakken received, and in May 2021 and 2022, Mr.
Bakken will receive a cash bonus equal to 30% of $654,078, his base salary as
of May 1, 2019. The three-year period covered and percentage of base salary
paid to Mr. Bakken under the plan are consistent with the terms of
participation of other senior executive officers who participate in this plan.

  

Risk Mitigation and Other Pay Practices

  

Entergy Corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and
practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as
well as other companies in the S&P 500. Some of these practices include the
following:

  

Clawback Provisions

  

Entergy Corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs. Under
the policy, which goes beyond the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(Sarbanes-Oxley), incentives paid to covered executive officers are required
to be reimbursed where:

  

•(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial
results with respect to the applicable performance period that were
subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement other than
a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material
miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial
statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have
been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results
or correct calculation; or

483

Table of Contents

•in the Board of Directors’ view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that
caused or partially caused the need for a restatement or caused a material
miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the
financial statements were restated.

  

The amount required to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross
incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the
original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results
or correct calculation. In addition, Entergy Corporation will seek to recover
any compensation received by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer that is required to be reimbursed under Sarbanes-Oxley following a
material restatement of Entergy Corporation’s financial statements.

  

Stock Ownership Guidelines and Share Retention Requirements

  

For many years, Entergy Corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for
executives, including the NEOs. These guidelines are designed to align the
executives’ long-term financial interests with the interests of Entergy
Corporation’s shareholders. Annually, the Personnel Committee monitors the
executive officers’ compliance with these guidelines with all of the NEOs
satisfying the applicable ownership guidelines at that time. The ownership
guidelines are as follows:

  

The ownership guidelines are as follows:

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Role | Value of Common Stock to be Owned |  |  |  | |
|Chief Executive Officer (ML-1) | 6 x base salary |  |  |  | |
|Executive Vice Presidents (ML-2) | 3 x base salary |  |  |  | |
|Senior Vice Presidents (ML-3) | 2 x base salary |  |  |  | |
|Vice Presidents (ML-4) | 1 x base salary |  |  |  | |
  
  

Further, to facilitate compliance with the guidelines, until an executive
officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:

  

•all net after-tax shares paid out under the LTIP;

•all net after-tax shares of the restricted stock and restricted stock units
received upon vesting; and

•at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of
Entergy Corporation stock options.

  

Trading Controls

  

Executive officers, including the NEOs, are required to receive permission
from Entergy Corporation’s General Counsel or his designee prior to entering
into any transaction involving Entergy Corporation securities, including
gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. Trading is generally
permitted only during specified open trading windows beginning shortly after
the release of earnings. Employees, who are subject to trading restrictions,
including the NEOs, may enter into trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Exchange Act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open
trading window and must be approved by Entergy Corporation. A NEO bears full
responsibility if he or she violates Entergy Corporation’s policy by buying or
selling shares of Entergy Corporation stock without pre-approval or when
trading is restricted.

  

Entergy Corporation also prohibits directors and executive officers, including
the NEOs, from pledging any Entergy Corporation securities or entering into
margin accounts involving Entergy Corporation securities. Entergy Corporation
prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of Entergy
Corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the
required approval of the General Counsel.

  

Entergy Corporation also has adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits
officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization
transactions involving Entergy Corporation’s common stock. Prohibited
transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale
contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps
or other derivatives that are directly linked to Entergy Corporation’s stock
or transactions involving “short-sales” of its common stock.

Compensation Consultant Independence

  

Annually, the Personnel Committee reviews the relationship with its
compensation consultant to determine whether any conflicts of interest exist
that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Personnel
Committee. Factors considered by the committee when assessing the independence
of its compensation consultant included, among others:

  

•Pay Governance has policies in place to prevent conflicts of interest;

•No member of Pay Governance’s consulting team serving the committee has a
business relationship with any member of the committee or any of Entergy
Corporation’s executive officers;

•Neither Pay Governance nor any of its principals own any shares of Entergy
Corporation’s common stock; and

•The amount of fees paid to Pay Governance is less than 1% of Pay Governance’s
total consulting income.

  

Based on these factors, the Personnel Committee concluded that Pay Governance
is independent in accordance with SEC and NYSE rules and that no conflicts of
interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising
the committee.

  

In addition, Pay Governance has agreed that it will not accept any engagement
with management without prior approval from the Personnel Committee, and
Entergy Corporation’s Board has adopted a policy that prohibits a compensation
consultant from providing other services to it if the aggregate amount for
those services would exceed $120,000 in any year. During 2020, Pay Governance
did not provide any services to Entergy Corporation other than the services it
performed on behalf of the Personnel and Corporate Governance Committees, and
it worked with Entergy Corporation’s management only as directed by the
committees.

  

PERSONNEL COMMITTEE REPORT

  

The Personnel Committee Report included in the Entergy Corporation Proxy
Statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be “filed”
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. None of the Registrant Subsidiaries has a
compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent
functions. The board of directors of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is
comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of Entergy Corporation
or one of the Registrant Subsidiaries. These boards do not make determinations
regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

(1)Mr. Ellis was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy New Orleans in
December 2018, and Ms. Landreaux was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy
Arkansas in July 2018.

(2)The amounts in column (c) represent the actual base salary paid to the NEOs
in the applicable year. The 2020 base salary amounts include an amount
attributable to an extra pay period that occurred in 2020 as the NEOs are paid
on a bi-weekly basis. The 2020 changes in base salaries noted in the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis were effective in April 2020.

(3)The amount in column (d) in 2020, 2019, and 2018 for Mr. Bakken represents
the cash bonus paid to him pursuant to the Nuclear Retention Plan. See
“Nuclear Retention Plan” in Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The amount
in column (d) in 2018 for Mr. Ellis represents a cash sign-on bonus paid in
connection with his commencement of employment with Entergy New Orleans.

(4)The amounts in column (e) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of
restricted stock and performance units granted under the 2015 Equity Ownership
Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “2015 EOP”) and the 2019 OIP
(together with the 2015 EOP, the “Equity Plans”), each calculated in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, without taking into account estimated
forfeitures. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock is based on the
closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant. The
grant date fair value of the portion of the performance units with vesting
based on the total shareholder return was measured using a Monte Carlo
simulation valuation model. The simulation model applies a risk-free interest
rate and an expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is
assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date.
Volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding
the grant date. The performance units in the table are also valued based on
the probable outcome of the applicable performance condition at the time of
grant. The maximum value of shares that would be received if the highest
achievement level is attained with respect to both the total shareholder
return and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, for performance units granted in 2020
are as follows: Mr. Bakken,

(5)The amounts in column (f) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of
stock options granted under the Equity Plans calculated in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in
valuing these awards, see Note 12 to the financial statements.

(6)The amounts in column (g) represent annual incentive award cash payments
made under the 2019 OIP.

(7)For all NEOs, the amounts in column (h) include the annual actuarial
increase in the present value of these NEOs’ benefits under all pension plans
established by Entergy Corporation using interest rate and mortality rate
assumptions consistent with those used in Entergy Corporation’s financial
statements and include amounts which the NEOs may not currently be entitled to
receive because such amounts are not vested (see “2020 Pension Benefits”). The
increase in pension benefits for all of the NEOs in 2020 was driven by a
decline in the discount rate that was a result of the decrease in prevailing
interest rates. None of the increases for any of the NEOs is attributable to
above-market or preferential earnings on non-qualified deferred compensation.
For 2018, the aggregate change in the actuarial present value was a decrease
of pension benefits of $52,000 for Mr. Fisackerly, $163,000 for Mr. Marsh,
$700 for Mr. May, $110,700 for Ms. Rainer, and $149,300 for Mr. West.

(8)The amounts in column (i) for 2020 include (a) matching contributions by
Entergy Corporation under the Savings Plan to each of the NEOs; (b) dividends

(9)In order to show the effect that the year-over-year change in pension value
had on total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, we have
included an additional column to show total compensation minus the change in
pension value. The amounts reported in the Total Without Change in Pension
Value column may differ substantially from the amounts reported in the Total
column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total
compensation. Total Without Change in Pension Value represents total
compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the change in
pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Earnings column. The change in pension value is subject
to many external variables, such as interest rates, assumptions about life
expectancy and changes in the discount rate determined at each year end, which
are functions of economic factors and actuarial calculations that are not
related to Entergy Corporation’s performance and are outside of the control of
the Personnel Committee.

For security and business reasons, Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive
Officer is permitted to use its corporate aircraft for personal use at the
expense of Entergy Corporation. The other NEOs may use the corporate aircraft
for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation’s Chief
Executive Officer. The Personnel Committee reviews the level of usage
throughout the year. Entergy Corporation believes that its officers’ ability
to use its plane for limited personal use saves time and provides additional
security for them, thereby benefiting Entergy Corporation. The amounts
included in column (i) for the personal use of corporate aircraft, reflect the
incremental cost to Entergy Corporation for use of the corporate aircraft,
determined on the basis of the variable operational costs of each flight,
including fuel, maintenance, flight crew travel expense, catering,
communications, and fees, including flight planning, ground handling, and
landing permits. The aggregate incremental aircraft usage cost associated with
Mr. Denault’s personal use of the corporate aircraft was $86,618 for fiscal
year 2020. In addition, Entergy Corporation offers its executives
comprehensive annual physical exams at Entergy Corporation’s expense. None of
the other perquisites referenced above exceeded $25,000 for any of the other
NEOs.

(1)The amounts in columns (c), (d), and (e) represent minimum, target, and
maximum payment levels under the annual incentive program. The actual amounts
awarded are reported in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table.

(2)The amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and
maximum payment levels under the LTIP. Performance under the program is
measured by Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to the
total shareholder returns of the companies included in the Philadelphia
Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS with total shareholder
return weighted eighty percent and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS weighted
twenty percent. There is no payout under the program if Entergy Corporation’s
total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer
companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted
EPS is below the minimum performance goal. Subject to the achievement of
performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of Entergy
Corporation’s common stock on the last day of the performance period (December
31, 2022). Accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in Entergy
Corporation common stock.

(3)The amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock granted
under the 2019 OIP. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the
first through third anniversaries of the grant date, have voting rights, and
accrue dividends during the vesting period.

(4)The amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of Entergy
Corporation’s common stock. The options vest one-third on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from
the date of grant. The options were granted under the 2019 OIP.

(5)The amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair
value of the award calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and, in
the case of the performance units, are based on the probable outcome of the
applicable performance conditions. See Notes 4 and 5 to the 2020 Summary
Compensation Table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in
calculating the grant date fair value.

(1)As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May,
and Ms. Rainer were retirement eligible.

(2)In 2006, Mr. Denault entered into a retention agreement granting him
additional years of service and permission to retire under the non-qualified
System Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in the event his employment is
terminated by his Entergy employer other than for cause (as defined in the
retention agreement), by Mr. Denault for good reason (as defined in the
retention agreement), or on account of his death or disability. His retention
agreement also provides that if he terminates employment for any other reason,
he shall be entitled to up to an additional 15 years of service under the SERP
only if his Entergy employer grants him permission to retire subject to the
overall 30 year cap on service credit under the SERP. The amount reflected in
the table for the SERP is calculated based on 30 years of service. The
additional years of service credited to Mr. Denault under his retention
agreement increased the present value of Mr. Denault’s benefit by $4,020,200.

(3)Service under the SERP is granted from the date of hire. Service under the
qualified Entergy Retirement Plan is granted from the later of the date of
hire or the plan participation date.  The SERP amounts reflected in the table
for Mr. May and Ms. Rainer are calculated based on 30 years of service
pursuant to the terms of the SERP.

Retirement Benefit Formula | Benefits are calculated as a single life annuity | 
payable at age 65 and generally are equal to 1.5% of a participant’s Final
Average Monthly Earnings (FAME) multiplied by years of service (not to exceed
40).  
  
“Earnings” for the purpose of calculating FAME generally includes the
employee’s base salary and eligible annual incentive awards subject to
Internal Revenue Code limitations, and excludes all other bonuses. Executive
annual incentive awards are not eligible for inclusion in Earnings under this
plan.  
  
FAME is calculated using the employee’s average monthly Earnings for the 60
consecutive months in which the employee’s earnings were highest during the
120 month  
period immediately preceding the employee’s retirement and includes up to 5
eligible annual incentive awards paid during the 60 month period.  
  
  
| The normal retirement benefit at age 65 is determined by converting the sum
of an employee’s annual pay credits and his or her annual interest credits,
into an actuarially equivalent annuity.  
  
Pay credits ranging from 4-8% of an employee’s eligible Earnings are allocated
annually to a notional account for the employee based on an employee’s age and
years of service. Earnings for purposes of calculating an employee’s pay
credit include the employee’s base salary and annual incentive awards subject
to Internal Revenue Code limitations and exclude all other bonuses. Executive
annual incentive awards are eligible for inclusion in Earnings under this
plan.  
  
Interest credits are calculated based upon the annual rate of interest on
30-year U.S. Treasury securities, as specified by the Internal Revenue
Service, for the month of August preceding the first day of the applicable
calendar year subject to a minimum rate of 2.6% and a maximum rate of 9%.

A reduced terminated vested benefit may be commenced as early as age 55. The
amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit
by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and 6% per
year for each additional year commencement precedes age 65.  
  
A subsidized early retirement benefit may be commenced by employees who are at
least age 55 with 10 years of service at the time they separate from service.
The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement
benefit by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65.|
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.  
  
A vested cash balance benefit can be commenced as early as the first day of
the month following separation from service. The amount of the benefit is
determined in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit described above
in the “Retirement Benefit Formula” section.  
  
  

Non-qualified Retirement Benefits

The NEOs are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement
benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the Pension
Equalization Plan (“PEP”), the Cash Balance Equalization Plan, and the SERP.
Each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan
that provides benefits to key management employees. In these plans, as
described below, an executive may participate in one or more non-qualified
plans, but is only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the
highest benefit. In general, upon disability, participants in the PEP and the
SERP remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of
recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement
eligibility. Generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of
benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant’s accrued benefit.

2020 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation

  

As of December 31, 2020, Mr. May had a deferred account balance under a frozen
Defined Contribution Restoration Plan. The amount is deemed invested, as
chosen by Mr. May, in certain T. Rowe Price investment funds that are also
available to the participant under the Savings Plan. Mr. May has elected to
receive the deferred account balance after he retires. The Defined
Contribution Restoration Plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible
employees’ deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent
contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee
participated were subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

2020 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

  

Entergy Corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation
to a NEO if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions,
including following a change in control of Entergy Corporation or its
subsidiaries.

Change in Control

Under Entergy Corporation’s System Executive Continuity Plan (the “Continuity
Plan”), ML 1-4 Officers are eligible to receive the severance benefits
described below if their employment is terminated by their Entergy System
employer other than for cause or if they terminate their employment for good
reason during a period beginning with a potential change in control and ending
24 months following the effective date of a change in control (a “Qualifying
Termination”). A participant will not be eligible for benefits under the
Continuity Plan if such participant: accepts employment with Entergy
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; elects to receive the benefits of
another severance or separation program; removes, copies or fails to return
any property belonging to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or
violates his or her non-compete provision (which generally runs for two years
but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law). Entergy
Corporation does not have any plans or agreements that provide for payments or
benefits to any of the NEOs solely upon a change in control.

  

In the event of a Qualifying Termination, executive officers, including the
NEOs, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:

501

* * *

Table of Contents

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Compensation Element | Payment |  |  |  | |
|Severance* | A lump sum severance payment equal to a multiple of the sum of: |  |  |  | |
(a) the participant’s annual base salary as in effect at any time within one
year prior to the commencement of a change of control period or, if higher,
immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason, plus (b) the
participant’s annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target
opportunity derived under the annual incentive program for the two calendar
years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs.  
Performance Units| Under the 2015 EOP and the performance unit agreements in
respect of the 2019 - 2021 performance period, participants would forfeit
outstanding performance units, and in lieu of any payment for any outstanding
performance period, would receive a single-lump sum payment calculated by
multiplying the target performance units for the most recent performance
period preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which termination
occurs by the closing price of Entergy’s common stock as of the later of the
date of such termination or the date of the Change in Control. Under the 2019
OIP and the performance unit agreements in respect of the 2020 - 2022
performance unit period, participants would receive a number of shares of
Entergy common stock equal to the greater of (1) the target number of
performance units subject to the performance unit agreement or (2) the number
of units that would vest under the performance unit agreement calculated based
on the performance of Entergy Corporation through the participant’s
termination date, in either case pro-rated based on the portion of the
performance period that occurs through the termination date.  
Equity Awards| All unvested stock options, shares of restricted stock and
restricted stock units will vest immediately upon a “double trigger”
Qualifying Termination pursuant to the terms of the 2015 EOP and 2019 OIP.  
Retirement Benefits| Benefits already accrued under the SERP, PEP and Cash
Balance Equalization Plan, if any, will become fully vested.  
Welfare Benefits| Participants who are not retirement-eligible would be
eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for a period ranging
from 12 to 18 months.  
  
* Cash severance payments are capped at 2.99 times the sum of (a) an executive’s annual base salary plus (b) the higher of his or her actual annual incentive payment under the annual incentive program or his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive program for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs. Any cash severance payments to be paid under the Continuity Plan in excess of this cap will be forfeited by the participant. 

To protect shareholders and Entergy Corporation’s business model, executives
are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation, confidentiality and
non-denigration provisions. If an executive discloses non-public data or
information concerning Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or
violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay
any benefits previously received under the Continuity Plan.

  

For purposes of the Continuity Plan the following events are generally defined
as:

  

•Change in Control: (a) the purchase of 30% or more of either Entergy
Corporation’s common stock or the combined voting power of Entergy
Corporation’s voting securities; (b) the merger or consolidation of Entergy
Corporation (unless its Board members constitute at least a majority of the
board members of the surviving entity); (c) the liquidation, dissolution or
sale of all or substantially all of Entergy Corporation’s assets; or (d) a
change in the composition of Entergy Corporation’s Board such that, during any
two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no
longer constitute a majority of Entergy Corporation’s Board at the end of the
period.

  

•Potential Change in Control: (a) Entergy Corporation or an affiliate enters
into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a Change in
Control; (b) the Entergy Corporation Board adopts resolutions determining
that, for purposes of the Continuity Plan, a potential Change in Control has
occurred; (c) a System Company or other person or entity publicly announces an
intention to take actions that would constitute a Change in Control; or (d)
any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly)

of Entergy Corporation’s outstanding shares of common stock constituting 20%
or more of the voting power or value of the Entergy Corporation’s outstanding
common stock.

  

•Cause: The participant’s (a) willful and continuous failure to perform
substantially his or her duties after written demand for performance; (b)
engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to Entergy Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries; (c) conviction or guilty or nolo contendere plea to a
felony or other crime that materially and adversely affects either his or her
ability to perform his or her duties or Entergy Corporation’s reputation; (d)
material violation of any agreement with Entergy Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries; or (e) disclosure of any of Entergy Corporation’s confidential
information without authorization.

  

•Good Reason: The participant’s (a) nature or status of duties and
responsibilities is substantially altered or reduced; (b) salary is reduced by
5% or more; (c) primary work location is relocated outside the continental
United States; (d) compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable
replacement; (e) benefits or number of vacation days are substantially

Mr. Denault’s 2006 Retention Agreement

  

In 2006, Entergy Corporation entered into a retention agreement with Mr.
Denault that provides benefits to him in addition to, or in lieu of, the
benefits described above. Specifically, in the event of a Termination Event
(as defined in his agreement): 1) Mr. Denault is entitled to a Target LTIP
Award calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with
respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year
in which his employment termination occurs, assuming all performance goals
were achieved at target; and 2) all of Mr. Denault’s unvested stock options
and shares of restricted stock will immediately vest.

  

In the event of death or disability, Mr. Denault would receive the greater of
the Target LTIP Award calculated as described above or the pro-rated number of
performance units for all open performance periods, based on the number of
months of his participation in each open performance period.

  

Under the terms of his 2006 retention agreement, Mr. Denault’s employment may
be terminated for cause upon Mr. Denault’s: (a) continuing failure to
substantially perform his duties (other than because of physical or mental
illness or after he has given notice of termination for good reason) that
remains uncured for 30 days after receiving a written notice from the
Personnel Committee; (b) willfully engaging in conduct that is demonstrably
and materially injurious to Entergy; (c) conviction of or entrance of a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime that has or may have a
material adverse effect on his ability to carry out his duties or upon
Entergy’s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement that he has
entered into with Entergy; or (e) unauthorized disclosure of Entergy’s
confidential information.

  

Mr. Denault may terminate his employment for good reason upon: (a) the
substantial reduction in the nature or status of his duties or
responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the date of the
retention agreement, other than de minimis acts that are remedied after notice
from Mr. Denault; (b) a reduction of 5% or more in his base salary as in
effect on the date of the retention agreement; (c) the relocation of his
principal place of employment to a location other than the corporate
headquarters; (d) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in
programs or plans providing opportunities for equity awards, incentive
compensation and other plans on a basis not materially less favorable than
enjoyed at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly
affecting all senior executives); (e) the failure to continue to allow him to
participate in programs or plans with opportunities for benefits not
materially less favorable than those enjoyed by him under any of the pension,
savings, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability or vacation
plans or policies at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes
similarly affecting all senior executives); or (f) any purported termination
of his employment not taken in accordance with his retention agreement.

  

Aggregate Termination Payments

  

The tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the NEOs would
have received if his or her employment had been terminated as of December 31,
2020 under the various scenarios described above. For purposes of these
tables, a stock price of $99.84 was used, which was the closing market price
of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the
year.

1)See “2020 Pension Benefits” for a description of the pension benefits Mr.
Bakken, Mr. Ellis, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West may receive upon the
occurrence of certain termination events.

2)As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May,
and Ms. Rainer are retirement eligible and would retire rather than
voluntarily resign, and in addition to the payments and benefits in the table,
Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer also would be
entitled to receive their vested pension benefits under the Entergy Retirement
Plan. For a description of these benefits, see “2020 Pension Benefits.”

  

3)For purposes of the table, in the event of a qualifying termination related
to a change in control, each NEO would receive a payment in respect of his
performance units for the 2019 – 2021 performance period and a number of
performance units for the 2020 – 2022 performance period, calculated as
follows.

  

For the 2019 – 2021 performance period, each NEO would be entitled to receive
a single-lump sum payment calculated using the target number of performance
units that the officer would have been entitled to receive under the 2015 EOP
with respect to the most recent performance period that precedes and does not
include the officer’s date of termination. The value of Mr. Denault’s payments
was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 – 2019
LTIP performance period (48,700) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation
stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $4,862,208
for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 – 2021 performance period.
The value of Mr. Bakken’s, Mr. Brown’s,

506

Table of Contents

Mr. Marsh’s, and Mr. West’s was calculated by multiplying the target
performance units for the 2017 – 2019 LTIP performance period (8,300) by the
closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84),
which would equal a payment of $828,672 for the forfeited performance units
for the 2019 – 2021 performance period. The value of Mr. May’s payment was
calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 – 2019
LTIP performance period (3,150) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation
stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $314,496
for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 – 2021 performance period.
The value of the payments for the other NEOs was calculated by multiplying the
target performance units for the 2017 – 2019 LTIP performance period (1,850)
by the closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020
($99.84), which would equal a payment of $184,704 for the forfeited
performance units for the 2019 – 2021 performance period.

  

For the 2020 – 2022 performance period, in the event of a qualifying
termination related to a change in control, each NEO would be entitled to
receive a number of shares of Entergy Corporation stock equal to the greater
of (1) the target number of performance units subject to the 2020 – 2022
performance unit agreement or (2) the number of performance units that would
vest under the 2020 – 2022 performance unit agreement calculated based on
Entergy Corporation’s actual performance through the NEO’s termination date,
in either case pro-rated based on the portion of the performance period that
occurs through the termination date. For purposes of the table, the values of
the performance unit awards for the 2020 – 2022 performance period for each
NEO were calculated as follows, based on the assumption that the target number
of performance units was the greater number:

  

Mr. Bakken: 2,586 (12/36*7,758) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $258,186

  

Mr. Brown: 2,524 (12/36*7,571) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $251,996

  

Mr. Denault: 10,421 (12/36*31,263) performance units at target, assuming a
stock price of $99.84 = $1,040,433

  

Mr. Ellis: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price
of $99.84 = $31,649

  

Mr. Fisackerly: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $31,649

  

Ms. Landreaux: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $31,649

  

Mr. May: 467 (12/36*1,400) performance units at target, assuming a stock price
of $99.84 = $46,625

  

Mr. Marsh: 3,187 (12/36*9,560) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $318,190

  

Ms. Rainer: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $31,649

  

Mr. West: 2,801 (12/36*8,401) performance units at target, assuming a stock
price of $99.84 = $279,652

  

The total values of the single sum payment for the 2019 – 2021 performance
period and the performance units award for the 2020 – 2022 performance period
upon a change in control for each NEO is as follows:

  

Mr. Bakken: $828,672 + $258,186 = $1,086,858

  

Mr. Brown: $828,672 + $251,996 = $1,080,668

  

Mr. Denault: $4,862,208 + $1,040,433 = $5,902,641

  

Mr. Ellis: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353

  

Mr. Fisackerly: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353

  

Ms. Landreaux: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353

Table of Contents

Mr. May: $314,496 + $46,625 = $361,121

  

Mr. Marsh: $828,672 + $318,190 = $1,146,862

  

Ms. Rainer: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353

  

Mr. West: $828,672 + $279,652 = $1,108,324

  

For purposes of the table, the values of the awards payable in the event of
retirement in the case of Mr. Denault, Mr. Brown, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, or
Ms. Rainer or upon death or disability, other than Mr. Denault, for each NEO
were calculated as follows:

Mr. Bakken’s:

  

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,379 (24/36*9,568) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $636,879

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 2,586 (12/36*7,758) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $258,186

Total: $895,065

  

Mr. Brown’s:

  

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,256 (24/36*9,383) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $$624,599

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 2,524 (12/36*7,571) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $251,996

Total: $876,595

  

Mr. Denault’s:

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 27,006 (24/36*40,508) performance units
at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $2,696,279

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 10,421 (12/36*31,263) performance units
at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $1,040,433

Total: $3,736,712

  

Mr. Marsh’s:

  

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 7,913 (24/36*11,869) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $790,034

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 3,187 (12/36*9,560) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $318,190

Total: $1,108,224

Mr. May’s:

  

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 1,434 (24/36*2,150) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $143,171

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 467 (12/36*1,400) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $46,625

Total: $189,796

Mr. Ellis’s, Mr. Fisackerly’s, Ms. Landreaux’s and Ms. Rainer’s:

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 967 (24/36*1,450) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $96,545

Table of Contents

2020 – 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at
target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649

Total: $128,194

  

Mr. West’s:

  

2019 – 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,716 (24/36*10,073) performance units at

target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $279,652

Total: $950,177

  

4)For purposes of the table, the value of Mr. Denault’s retention payment was
calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2016
- 2018 LTIP (41,700) and from the 2017 - 2019 LTIP (48,700). This average
number of units (45,200) multiplied by the closing price of Entergy stock on
December 31, 2020 ($99.84) would equal a payment of $4,512,768.

  

5)Pursuant to the SERP, in the event of a termination related to a change in
control, Mr. Bakken, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West would be eligible to receive
Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 18 months and Mr. Ellis and Ms.
Landreaux would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for
12 months.

  

6)Upon retirement, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms.
Rainer would be eligible for retiree medical and dental benefits, the same as
all other retirees.

  

7)Mr. Bakken’s 20,000 restricted stock units vest in two equal installments on
April 6, 2022 and April 6, 2025. In the event of a change in control, the
unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. Bakken’s Qualifying
Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted
stock unit agreement, Mr. Bakken is subject to certain restrictions on his
ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates or solicit its employees or
customers during and for 12 months after his employment with his Entergy
employer. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Bakken’s
ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of
these restrictions, other than following certain constructive terminations of
his employment, Mr. Bakken will forfeit any restricted stock units that are
not yet vested and paid, and must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock
paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he
received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares.

  

Pay Ratio

  

As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, the following disclosure is being provided about the
relationship of the annual total compensation of the employees of each of the
Utility operating companies to the annual total compensation of their
respective Presidents and Chief Executive Officers. The pay ratio estimate for
each of the Utility operating companies has been calculated in a manner
consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

  

Identification of Median Employee

  

For each of the Utility operating companies, October 2, 2020 was selected as
the date on which to determine the median employee. This date is different
from the date used in the prior year; however, the methodology used to
determine the date is consistent with that used in the prior year. Both dates
correspond to the first day of the three month period prior to fiscal year-end
for which information can be obtained about employees and all subsidiaries
have the same number of pay cycles. To identify the median employee from each
of the Utility operating companies’ employee population base, all compensation
included in Box 5 of Form W-2 was considered with all before-tax deductions
added back to this compensation (“Box 5 Compensation”). For purposes of
determining the median employee of each Utility operating company, Box 5
Compensation was selected as it is believed to be representative of the
compensation received by the employees of each respective Utility operating
company and is readily available.

grants. The deferred shares will be settled in cash in an amount equal to the
market value of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the deferral

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director
Independence

  

For information regarding certain relationship, related transactions and
director independence of Entergy Corporation, see the Entergy Corporation
Proxy Statement under the headings “Corporate Governance - Director
Independence” and “Corporate Governance - Corporate Governance Policies -
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions.”

  

Entergy Corporation’s Board of Directors has adopted a written Related Party
Transaction Approval Policy that applies to any transaction or series of
transactions in which Entergy Corporation or a subsidiary is a participant:

  

•When the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and

•When a Related Party (an Entergy Corporation director or executive officer,
any nominee for director, any shareholder owning an excess of 5% of the total
equity of Entergy Corporation and any immediate family member of any such
person) has a direct or indirect material interest in such transaction(s)
(other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10%
beneficial owner of another entity).

The policy is administered by Entergy Corporation’s Corporate Governance
Committee. The committee will consider relevant facts and circumstance in
determining whether or not to approve or ratify such a transaction, and will
approve or ratify only those transactions that are, in the Corporate
Governance Committee’s judgment, appropriate or desirable under the
circumstances. The Corporate Governance Committee has determined that certain
types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material
interest, including (i) compensation and related party transactions involving
a director or an executive officer solely resulting from service as a director
or employment with Entergy Corporation so long as the compensation is approved
by the Entergy Corporation Board of Directors (or an appropriate committee);
(ii) transactions involving public utility services at rates or charges fixed
in conformity with law or governmental authority; or (iii) all business
relationships between Entergy Corporation and a Related Party made in the
ordinary course of business on terms and conditions generally available in the
marketplace an in accordance with applicable law. To Entergy Corporation’s
knowledge, since January 1, 2020, neither Entergy Corporation nor any of its
affiliates has participated in any Related Party transaction.

Entergy Audit Committee Guidelines for Pre-approval of Independent Auditor
Services

  

The Audit Committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the
engagement of Entergy’s independent auditor to perform services for Entergy:

  

1.The independent auditor will provide the Audit Committee, for approval, an
annual engagement letter outlining the scope of services proposed to be
performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other
permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and
all other services).

2.For other permissible services not included in the engagement letter,
Entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service,
including a budget estimate, to the Audit Committee for pre-approval.
Management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service
is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor independence prior to submission
to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, at its discretion, will pre-
approve permissible services and has established the following additional
guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent
auditor:

aAggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the
approved audit service fee.

bAll other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it
is a highly qualified provider of that service or if the Audit Committee pre-
approves the independent audit firm to provide the service.

3.The Audit Committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-
approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.

4.To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee
delegates to the Audit Committee Chair or its designee the authority to
approve permissible services and fees. The Audit Committee Chair or designee
will report action taken to the Audit Committee at the next scheduled Audit
Committee meeting.

5.The Vice President and General Auditor will be responsible for tracking all
independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the Audit Committee.

Exhibit 4(a)11

DESCRIPTION OF ENTERGY CORPORATION’S SECURITIES

  

REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12

  

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

  

References in this exhibit to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Entergy Corporation,
and does not include our subsidiaries.

  

As of February 26, 2021, the only security registered by us under Section
12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)
is our common stock, par value $0.01.

  

The following descriptions of our common stock and the relevant provisions of
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws are summaries and are qualified by
reference to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that are filed as
exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this is filed as an
exhibit. The following also summarizes certain applicable provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and that summary
is qualified by reference to the DGCL.

  

General

  

Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share.

  

Dividend Rights

  

We will pay dividends on our common stock as determined by our board of
directors out of legally available funds. Our ability to pay dividends depends
primarily upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or
distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. Various financing
arrangements, charter provisions and regulatory requirements may impose
certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to
us in the form of cash dividends or distributions, loans or advances.

  

Voting Rights

  

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held by them
on all matters submitted to our shareholders. Holders of our common stock do
not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Unless
otherwise required by law, in all matters other than the election of
directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
represented at a shareholder meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the shareholders. At a meeting for the election of
directors at which a quorum is present, directors are elected by a majority of
votes cast with respect to such director; provided, however, that, if the
number of nominees is greater than the number of directors who will be
elected, the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast will be elected
as directors.

  

Liquidation Rights

  

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs,
voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of our common stock will be entitled
to receive the remainder, if any, of our assets after the payment of all our
debts and liabilities.

  

Preemptive Rights

  

* * *

  

  

The holders of our common stock do not have a preemptive right to purchase
shares of our common stock or securities convertible into such shares nor are
they liable for future capital calls or to assessments by us.

  

Listing

  

Our common stock is listed under the “ETR” symbol on both the New York Stock
Exchange and the NYSE Chicago.

  

Transfer Agent and Registrar

  

The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Equiniti Trust
Company, doing business as EQ Shareowner Services.

  

Certain Anti-Takeover Effects

  

General. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
the DGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an
acquisition of control of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open
market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our board of
directors. The provisions described below may reduce our vulnerability to an
unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or substantially all
of our assets or an unsolicited takeover attempt which is unfair to our
shareholders.

  

Our board of directors has no present intention to introduce additional
measures that might have an anti-takeover effect; however, our board of
directors expressly reserves the right to introduce these measures in the
future.

  

Business Combinations. Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held
Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an
“interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the time the
stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions,
including if, prior to such time, the board of directors approved the business
combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an
interested stockholder. “Business combinations” include mergers, asset sales
and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the “interested
stockholder.” Subject to various exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a
person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or
within the prior three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s
outstanding voting stock. The restrictions on business combinations with
interested stockholders contained in Section 203 do not apply to a corporation
whose certificate of incorporation or bylaws contains a provision expressly
electing not to be governed by the statute; however, neither our certificate
of incorporation nor our bylaws contain a provision electing to “opt-out” of
Section 203.

  

Special Meetings. Pursuant to the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may
be called by the board of directors or by any other person authorized to do so
in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may
only be called by: our board of directors; the Chairman of our board of
directors; a majority of the members of the entire Executive Committee of the
board of directors; the Chief Executive Officer; or the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting.

  

Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Nominations and Proposals. Our
bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder
proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as
directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of

  

* * *

  

directors or a committee of the board of directors. A stockholder who wishes
to bring a matter before a meeting must comply with our advance notice
requirements and provide us with certain information. Additionally, vacancies
and newly created directorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of
the directors then in office, even in the case that such directors may
represent less than a quorum.

Exhibit 4(c)7

DESCRIPTION OF ENTERGY ARKANSAS, LLC’S SECURITIES

  

REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12

  

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

  

References in this exhibit to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Entergy Arkansas,
LLC.

  

We have issued, and may from time to time issue, bonds in one or more series
under one or more separate supplemental indentures to the Mortgage and Deed of
Trust dated as of October 1, 1944, with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,
successor corporate trustee, and, as to property in Missouri, The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor co-trustee, and together referred
to in this exhibit as “trustees.” This Mortgage and Deed of Trust, as it has
heretofore been and may be amended or supplemented from time to time, is
referred to in this exhibit as the “mortgage.” All first mortgage bonds issued
or to be issued under the mortgage, including the Bonds (as defined below),
are referred to herein as “first mortgage bonds.”

  

As of February 26, 2021, we have one series of first mortgage bonds
outstanding that is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our First Mortgage Bonds, 4.875%
Series due September 1, 2066, issued in an aggregate principal amount of
$410,000,000 under the Seventy-Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
August 1, 2016, to the mortgage and traded on the NYSE under the ticker EAI
(the “Bonds”). The full aggregate principal amount of the Bonds is currently
outstanding.

  

The mortgage, including the supplemental indenture relating to the Bonds,
contains the full legal text of the matters described herein. Because this is
a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the mortgage, the supplemental
indenture relating to the Bonds, or the outstanding first mortgage bonds,
including the Bonds. The mortgage and the supplemental indentures that relate
to the outstanding first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds, are filed as
exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this is filed as an
exhibit. You should read the mortgage for provisions that may be important to
you. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to
all the provisions of the mortgage, including the definitions of some of the
terms used in the mortgage, and to the particular terms of the supplemental
indenture that relates to the Bonds. The mortgage has been qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and you should also refer to the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939 for provisions that apply to the Bonds.

  

General

  

The mortgage permits us to issue first mortgage bonds from time to time
subject to limitations described below under “Issuance of Additional First
Mortgage Bonds.” All first mortgage bonds of any one series need not be issued
at the same time, and a series may be reopened for issuances of additional
first mortgage bonds of that series. This means that we may from time to time,
without the consent of the existing holders of the first mortgage bonds of any
series, including the Bonds, create and issue additional first mortgage bonds
of a series having the same terms and conditions as the previously issued
first mortgage bonds of that series in all respects, except for issue date,
issue price and, if applicable, the initial interest payment on those
additional first mortgage bonds. Additional first mortgage bonds issued in
this manner will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the
previously issued first mortgage bonds of that series. For more information,
see the discussion below under “Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds.”

  

* * *

  

  

Payment

  

The principal amount of the Bonds and interest thereon is and will be paid in
any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of
payment is legal tender at the corporate trust office of the corporate trustee
in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York.

  

Interest on the Bonds accrues at the rate of 4.875% per year. Interest started
to accrue from the date that the Bonds were issued. Interest payments on the
Bonds are made on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year. As
long as the Bonds are registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) or its nominee, the record date for interest payable on any interest
payment date shall be the close of business on the Business Day (defined as
any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which banking
institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or
executive order to remain closed or a day on which the corporate trust office
of the corporate trustee is closed for business) immediately preceding such
interest payment date. We have agreed to pay interest on any overdue principal
and, if such payment is enforceable under applicable law, on any overdue
installment of interest on the Bonds at a rate of 6% per year to holders of
record at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding our
payment of such interest.

  

Interest on the Bonds is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months. If any interest payment date or the maturity date of the Bonds
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on that interest
payment date or the maturity date will be made on the next Business Day, and
without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay.

  

As long as the Bonds are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, we will
pay principal and interest due on the Bonds to DTC. DTC will then make payment
to its participants for disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Bonds as
described under the heading “Book-Entry Only Securities.”

  

Redemption

  

We may redeem the Bonds prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at our option,
on not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice, at any time on or
after September 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Bonds being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Unless the Bonds are held
in book-entry only form through the facilities of DTC, in which case DTC’s
procedures for selection shall apply (see “Book-Entry Only Securities”), if
less than all of the Bonds are to be redeemed, the corporate trustee will
select the Bonds to be redeemed.

  

Unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest,
if any, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Bonds
subject to such notice of redemption will cease to bear interest on the
redemption date. We will pay the redemption price and any accrued interest to
the redemption date upon surrender of any Bond for redemption. If only part of
a Bond is redeemed, the corporate trustee will deliver to the holder of the
Bond a new Bond for the remaining portion without charge.

  

We may make any redemption at our option conditional upon the receipt by the
corporate trustee, prior to the date fixed for redemption, of money sufficient
to pay the redemption price and accrued interest, if any. If the corporate
trustee has not received the money by the date fixed for redemption, we will
not be required to redeem the Bonds.

  

Form and Exchange

  

* * *

  

  

The Bonds are fully-registered bonds without coupons, issued in denominations
of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. The Bonds are
represented by a global certificate without coupons registered in the name of
a nominee of DTC.

  

The Bonds are exchangeable for other Bonds in equal aggregate principal
amounts. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of the Bonds. However, we may require payment to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with a
registration of transfer or exchange. We will not be required to provide for
the transfer or exchange of any Bond:

  

1.during the 10 days before an interest payment date,

2.during the 10 days before any designation of such Bond to be redeemed, or

3.selected for redemption.

  

Security

  

The Bonds, together with all other first mortgage bonds now or in the future
outstanding under the mortgage, are and will be secured, equally and ratably,
by the lien of the mortgage. The mortgage constitutes a first mortgage lien on
substantially all of our property (the “mortgaged property”) subject to
bankruptcy law and to:

  

1.leases of minor portions of our mortgaged property to others for uses which
do not interfere with our business;

2.leases of certain of our mortgaged property not used in our business; and

3.excepted encumbrances (as defined below).

  

There is excepted from the lien certain of our property, including:

  

1.cash and securities;

2.certain equipment, materials and supplies;

3.automobiles and other vehicles and aircraft, timber, minerals, mineral
rights and royalties;

4.receivables, contracts, leases and operating agreements; and

5.certain unimproved lands sold or to be sold.

  

The “excepted encumbrances” mean the following:

  

•tax liens, assessments and other governmental charges or requirements which
are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•mechanics’, workmen’s, repairmen’s, materialmen’s, warehousemen’s and
carriers’ liens, other liens incident to construction, liens or privileges of
any of our employees for salary or wages earned, but not yet payable, and
other liens, including without limitation liens for worker’s compensation
awards, arising in the ordinary course of business for charges or requirements
which are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•specified judgment liens and prepaid liens;

•easements, leases, reservations or other rights of others (including
governmental entities) in, and defects of title in, our property;

  

* * *

  

•liens securing indebtedness or other obligations relating to real property we
acquired for specified transmission, distribution or communication purposes or
for the purpose of obtaining rights-of-way;

•specified leases and leasehold, license, franchise and permit interests;

•liens resulting from laws, rules, regulations, orders or rights of
governmental authorities and specified liens required by law or governmental
regulations;

•liens to secure public obligations; rights of others to take minerals,
timber, electric energy or capacity, gas, water, steam or other products
produced by us or by others on our property;

•rights and interests of persons other than us arising out of agreements
relating to the common ownership or joint use of property, and liens on the
interests of those persons in the property;

•restrictions on assignment and/or requirements of any assignee to qualify as
a permitted assignee and/or public utility or public services corporation; and

•liens which have been bonded for the full amount in dispute or for the
payment of which other adequate security arrangements have been made.

  

The mortgage contains provisions that impose the lien of the mortgage on
property that we acquire after the date of the mortgage, other than excepted
property, subject to pre-existing liens. However, if we consolidate or merge
with, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our mortgaged property
to, a successor, the lien created by the mortgage will generally not cover the
property of the successor, other than the mortgaged property it acquires from
us and improvements, replacements and additions to such property.

  

The mortgage also provides that the trustees shall have a lien upon the
mortgaged property to ensure the payment of their reasonable compensation,
expenses and disbursements and for indemnity against certain liabilities. This
lien takes priority over the lien securing the first mortgage bonds, including
the Bonds.

  

The mortgage also contains restrictions on the issuance of debt secured by a
prior lien on the mortgaged property (“qualified lien bonds”).

  

Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds

  

The maximum principal amount of first mortgage bonds that may be issued under
the mortgage is limited to $100 billion at any time outstanding under the
mortgage, subject to property additions and other limitations of the mortgage.
First mortgage bonds of any series may be issued from time to time on the
basis of:

  

1.60% of the cost or fair value, whichever is less, of unfunded property
additions after adjustments to offset retirements;

2.retirements of first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds; or

3.deposit of cash with the corporate trustee.

  

Property additions generally include, among other things, electric, gas, steam
or hot water property acquired after June 30, 1944. Securities, automobiles or
other vehicles or aircraft, or property used principally for the production or
gathering of natural gas, are not included as property additions.

  

We have the right to amend the mortgage at any time without the consent or
other action of the holders of any first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds,
to permit the issuance of first mortgage bonds on the basis of 80% of the cost
or fair value, whichever is less, of unfunded property additions after
adjustments to offset retirements.

  

  

* * *

  

We have the right to amend the mortgage at any time without any consent or
other action of the holders of any first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds,
to make any form of space satellites including solar power satellites, space
stations and other analogous facilities available as property additions.

  

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $3,981 million principal amount
of first mortgage bonds outstanding. Also as of December 31, 2020, we had
approximately $1,003 million of available property additions, entitling us to
issue approximately $602 million principal amount of additional first mortgage
bonds on the basis of property additions, and we could have issued
approximately $802 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds
on the basis of retired first mortgage bonds. These amounts do not reflect our
repayment at maturity of $350 million aggregate principal amount of first
mortgage bonds on February 15, 2021, which decreased the principal amount
outstanding to $3,631 million and increased the amount issuable on the basis
of retired first mortgage bonds to $1,152 million. The Bonds were issued on
the basis of property additions.

  

Other than the security afforded by the lien of the mortgage and restrictions
on the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds described above, there are
no provisions of the mortgage that grant the holders of the first mortgage
bonds protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction involving us.

  

Release and Substitution of Property

  

We may release property from the lien of the mortgage on the bases of:

  

1.the deposit of cash or, to a limited extent, purchase money mortgages;

2.property additions, after adjustments in certain cases to offset retirements
and after making adjustments for qualified lien bonds, if any, outstanding
against property additions; and

3.(i) the aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds that we would be
entitled to issue on the basis of retired qualified lien bonds; or (ii)
10/6ths of the aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds that we
would be entitled to issue on the basis of retired first bonds; in each case
with the entitlement being waived by operation of the release.

  

We can withdraw cash upon the bases stated in clause (2) and/or (3) above.
Should we amend the mortgage as described under “Issuance of Additional First
Mortgage Bonds” above to permit the issuance of first mortgage bonds on the
basis of an increased percentage of the cost or fair value, whichever is less,
of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset retirements, the
ratio specified in clause (3)(ii) above would change to the reciprocal of such
increased percentage.

  

The mortgage also contains special provisions with respect to qualified lien
bonds pledged and the disposition of moneys received on pledged prior lien
bonds. We may also release unfunded property if after such release at least
one dollar in unfunded property remains subject to the lien of the mortgage.
We have the right to amend the mortgage at any time without the consent or
other action of the holders of any first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds,
to modify the definition of “Funded Property” in the mortgage to mean property
specified by us with a fair value determined by an independent expert not less
than 10/8ths of the sum of the amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds
and retired first mortgage bonds.

  

We may, without any release or consent by the corporate trustee,

  

•grant, free from the lien of the mortgage, easements, ground leases or
rights-of-way in, upon, over and/or across our property for the purpose of
roads, pipe lines, transmission lines, distribution lines, communication lines
and similar purposes, or for the joint or common use of real property, rights-
of-way, facilities and/or equipment, but only if such grant shall not
materially impair the use

  

* * *

  

of the property or rights-of-way for the purposes for which such property or
rights-of-way are held by us, and

•cancel or make changes or alterations in or substitutions for any and all
easements, servitudes and similar rights and/or interests.

  

Modification

Modification Without Consent

  

Without the consent of any holder of first mortgage bonds, we and the trustees
may enter into one or more supplemental indentures for any of the following
purposes:

  

•to evidence the assumption by any permitted successor of our covenants in the
mortgage and in the first mortgage bonds;

•to add one or more covenants or other provisions for the benefit of the
holders of all or any series of first mortgage bonds, or to surrender any
right or power conferred upon us;

•to add additional events of default under the mortgage for all or any series
of first mortgage bonds;

•to correct or amplify the description of the mortgaged property or to subject
additional property to the lien of the mortgage;

•to change, eliminate or add any provision to the mortgage; provided that no
such change, elimination or addition will adversely affect the interests of
the holders of first mortgage bonds of any series in any material respect;

•to establish the form or terms of first mortgage bonds of any other series as
permitted by the mortgage;

•to provide for the procedures required for use of a noncertificated system of
registration for the first mortgage bonds of all or any series;

•to change any place where principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be
payable, first mortgage bonds may be surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange, and notices and demands to us may be served; or

•to cure any ambiguity or inconsistency or to make any other changes or
additions to the provisions of the mortgage if such changes or additions will
not adversely affect the interests of first mortgage bonds of any series in
any material respect.

  

Modification Requiring Consent

  

Except as provided below, the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of then outstanding first mortgage bonds,
considered as one class, is required for all other amendments or modifications
to the mortgage. However, if less than all of the series of first mortgage
bonds outstanding are directly affected by a proposed amendment or
modification, then the consent of the holders of only a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds of all series that
are directly affected, considered as one class, will be required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made
without the consent of the holder of each directly affected first mortgage
bond then outstanding to:

  

•extend the maturity of the principal of, or interest on, any first mortgage
bond, or reduce the principal amount of any first mortgage bond or its rate of
interest or modify the terms of payment of such principal or interest;

•create any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien of the mortgage
with respect to the mortgaged property, or deprive any non-assenting holder of
a first mortgage bond of a lien on the mortgaged property for the security of
such holder’s first mortgage bonds (subject only to excepted encumbrances); or

  

* * *

  

•reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding first mortgage
bonds of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any
amendment or modification.

  

The mortgage provides that first mortgage bonds owned by us, for our benefit
or by any entity of which we own 25% or more of the outstanding voting stock
shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of certain votes, consents or
quorums; provided that first mortgage bonds that have been pledged in good
faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the
satisfaction of the corporate trustee its right to vote or give consents with
respect to such first mortgage bonds and such pledgee is not us or an entity
of which we own 25% or more of the outstanding voting stock.

  

Any request, consent or vote of the owner of any first mortgage bond will bind
every future holder and owner of that first mortgage bond and the holder and
owner of every first mortgage bond issued upon the registration of transfer of
or in exchange for that first mortgage bond.

  

Defaults

  

Defaults under the mortgage include:

  

1.failure to pay the principal of any first mortgage bond when due and
payable;

2.failure to pay interest on any first mortgage bond or any installments of
any fund required to be applied to the purchase or redemption of any first
mortgage bond for a period of 60 days after the same shall have become due and
payable;

3.failure to pay interest upon or principal of any qualified lien bonds beyond
any applicable grace period;

4.certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; and

5.the expiration of 90 days after the mailing by the corporate trustee to us
of a written demand, or by holders of 15% in principal amount of the first
mortgage bonds at the time outstanding under the mortgage to us and to the
corporate trustee of a written demand, that we perform a specified covenant or
agreement contained in the mortgage, which specified covenant or agreement we
have failed to perform prior to such mailing, unless during such period we
shall have performed such specified covenant or agreement. The corporate
trustee may, and, if requested to do so in writing by the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the first mortgage bonds then outstanding,
shall, make such demand.

  

The trustees may withhold notice of default, except in payment of principal,
interest or funds for purchase or redemption of first mortgage bonds, if they
in good faith determine it is in the interests of the holders of the first
mortgage bonds.

  

Remedies

  

Acceleration of Maturity

  

If a default under the mortgage occurs, then the corporate trustee, by written
notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding first mortgage bonds, by written notice to us and the corporate
trustee, may declare the principal amount of all of the first mortgage bonds
to be due and payable immediately, and upon the giving of such notice, such
principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest will become immediately due
and payable.

  

There is no automatic acceleration, even in the event of our bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization.

  

  

* * *

  

Annulment of Acceleration

  

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made but before
any sale of the mortgaged property, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds may annul such declaration of
acceleration, by written notice to the trustees and us, if the default under
the mortgage giving rise to such declaration of acceleration has been cured,
and we have paid or deposited with the corporate trustee a sum sufficient to
pay:

  

(1) all overdue interest on all outstanding first mortgage bonds;

(2) the principal of and premium, if any, on the outstanding first mortgage
bonds that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration
and overdue interest thereon;

(3) interest on overdue interest, if any, to the extent lawful, at the rate of
6% per year; and

(4) all amounts due to the trustees under the mortgage.

  

Trustees’ Powers

  

Subject to the mortgage, under specified circumstances and to the extent
permitted by law, if a default under the mortgage occurs, the trustees shall
be entitled to the appointment of a receiver for the mortgaged property and
are entitled to all other remedies available under applicable law.

  

Control by Holders

  

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the first mortgage bonds may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any remedy
available to the trustees or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
trustees. The trustees are not obligated to comply with directions that
conflict with law or other provisions of the mortgage or that the corporate
trustee determines in good faith would involve the trustees in personal
liability, would be unjustifiably prejudicial to non-assenting holders or
would be in circumstances where indemnity would not be sufficient. The
trustees are not required to risk their funds or incur personal liability if
there is reasonable ground for believing that repayment is not reasonably
assured.

  

Limitation on Holders’ Right to Institute Proceedings

  

No holder of first mortgage bonds will have any right to institute any
proceeding under the mortgage, or any remedy under the mortgage, unless:

  

•the holder has previously given to the trustees written notice of a default
under the mortgage;

•the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding first
mortgage bonds of all series have made a written request to the trustees and
have offered the trustees reasonable opportunity and indemnity satisfactory to
the trustees to institute proceedings; and

•the trustees have failed to institute any proceeding for 60 days after
notice;

  

provided that no holder or holders of first mortgage bonds shall have any
right in any manner to affect or prejudice the lien of the mortgage or to
obtain priority over other holders of outstanding first mortgage bonds.
However, these limitations do not apply to the absolute and unconditional
right of a holder of a first mortgage bond to institute suit for payment of
the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the first mortgage bond on or
after the applicable due date.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage, without any consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created on or after May 1,
2018, to revise the limitations described in

  

* * *

  

the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph to apply to any
proceeding or remedy under or with respect to the mortgage or the first
mortgage bonds.

  

Evidence to be Furnished to the Trustee

  

Compliance with the mortgage provisions is evidenced by written statements of
our officers or persons we select or pay. In certain cases, opinions of
counsel and certifications of an engineer, accountant, appraiser or other
expert (who in some cases must be independent) must be furnished. We must give
the corporate trustee an annual certificate as to whether or not we have
fulfilled our obligations under the mortgage throughout the preceding year.

  

Satisfaction and Discharge of Mortgage

  

The mortgage may be satisfied and discharged if and when we provide for the
payment of all of the first mortgage bonds and all other sums due under the
mortgage.

  

Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance of Assets

  

The mortgage provides that we may consolidate with or merge into any other
entity or convey, transfer or lease as, or substantially as, an entirety to
any entity the mortgaged property, if:

  

•(a) the surviving or successor entity to such merger or consolidation has
authority to carry on the electric, gas, steam or hot water business, or (b)
the successor entity that acquires by conveyance or transfer or that leases
our mortgaged property as, or substantially as, an entirety, is authorized to
acquire, lease or operate the mortgaged property so conveyed or transferred;

•such merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease is upon such terms
as to preserve, and in no respect impair, the lien and security of the
mortgage and the rights and powers of the trustees and the holders of first
mortgage bonds;

•the survivor or successor entity expressly assumes by supplemental indenture
our obligations on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and under the
mortgage; and

•in the case of a lease, such lease is made expressly subject to termination
by us or by the trustees and by the purchaser of the property so leased at any
sale thereof at any time during the continuance of a default under the
mortgage.

  

In the case of the conveyance or other transfer of the mortgaged property as,
or substantially as, an entirety to another entity, upon the satisfaction of
all the conditions described above, we would be released and discharged from
all our obligations and covenants under the mortgage and on the first mortgage
bonds then outstanding unless we elect to waive such release and discharge.

  

The mortgage does not prevent or restrict any conveyance or other transfer, or
lease, of any part of the mortgaged property that does not constitute the
entirety, or substantially the entirety, of the mortgaged property.

  

Although the successor entity may, in its sole discretion, subject to the lien
of the mortgage property then owned or thereafter acquired by the successor
entity, the lien of the mortgage generally will not cover the property of the
successor entity other than the mortgaged property it acquires from us and
improvements, extensions and additions to such property and renewals,
replacements and substitutions thereof, within the meaning of the mortgage.

  

The terms of the mortgage do not restrict mergers in which we are the
surviving entity.

  

  

* * *

  

The mortgage provides that a statutory merger in which our assets and
liabilities may be allocated among one or more entities shall not be
considered to be a merger, consolidation or conveyance of mortgaged property
subject to the provisions of the mortgage relating to a merger, consolidation
or conveyance of all or substantially all of the mortgaged property unless all
or substantially all of the mortgaged property is allocated to one or more
other entities.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after on or after
May 1, 2018, to provide as follows:

  

(1) that any conveyance, transfer or lease of any of our properties where we
retain mortgaged property with a fair value in excess of 167% of the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds, and any other
outstanding debt secured by a purchase money lien that ranks equally with, or
senior to, the first mortgage bonds with respect to the mortgaged property,
shall not be deemed to be a conveyance, transfer or lease of all or
substantially all of our mortgaged property. This fair value will be
determined within 90 days of the conveyance, transfer or lease by an
independent expert selected by us; and

(2) that, in the case of a consolidation or merger after the consummation of
which we would be the surviving or resulting entity, unless we otherwise
provide in a supplemental indenture to the mortgage, the lien of the mortgage
will generally not cover any of the properties acquired by us in or as a
result of such transaction or any improvements, extensions or additions to
those properties.

.

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created on or after May 1,
2018, to provide that so long as no event of default or event that, after
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default has
occurred and is continuing and except with respect to a trustee appointed by
act of the holders, if we have delivered to the trustees a board resolution
appointing a successor for any trustee and the successor has accepted the

Book-Entry Only Securities

  

  

* * *

  

The Bonds trade through DTC. The Bonds are represented by a global certificate
registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee. The global certificate
was deposited with the corporate trustee as custodian for DTC. Ownership of
beneficial interests in the global certificates is limited to institutions
that have accounts with DTC or its participants or persons that may hold
interests through participants.

  

DTC is a New York clearing corporation and a clearing agency registered under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for its participants.
DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement of securities transactions
among its participants through electronic computerized book‑entry transfers
and pledges in the participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. The participants include
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by
the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Others who maintain a custodial
relationship with a participant can use the DTC system. The rules that apply
to DTC and those using its systems are on file with the SEC.

  

Purchases of the Bonds within the DTC system must be made through
participants, who will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The
beneficial ownership interest of each purchaser will be recorded on the
appropriate participant’s records. Beneficial owners do not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but beneficial owners should receive
written confirmations of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of
their holdings, from the participants through whom they purchased Bonds.
Transfers of ownership in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on
the books of the participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners.
Beneficial owners will not receive certificates for their Bonds of a series,
except if use of the book‑entry system for the Bonds of that series is
discontinued.

  

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by participants with
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the
Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. effects no
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial
owners of the Bonds. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the
participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited. These participants may
or may not be the beneficial owners. Participants are responsible for keeping
account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, and by
participants to beneficial owners, are governed by arrangements among them,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time. Beneficial owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to
augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to
the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults and proposed amendments to
the mortgage. Beneficial owners of the Bonds may wish to ascertain that the
nominee holding the Bonds has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to the
beneficial owners.

  

Redemption notices will be sent to Cede & Co., as registered holder of the
Bonds. If less than all of the Bonds of a series are being redeemed, DTC’s
practice is to determine by lot the amount of Bonds of such series held by
each participant to be redeemed.

  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote with respect to Bonds,
unless authorized by a participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under
its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as
possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or
voting rights of Cede & Co. to those participants to whose accounts the Bonds
are credited on the

  

* * *

  

record date. We believe that these arrangements will enable the beneficial
owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the rights that can be
directly exercised by a registered holder of the Bonds.

  

Payments of redemption proceeds, principal of, and interest on the Bonds are
and will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by
DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of
funds and corresponding detail information from us or our agent, on the
payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s
records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners are and will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Payments are the
responsibility of participants and not of DTC, the trustee, or us, subject to
any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to
time. Payment of redemption proceeds, principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or
such other nominee as may be requested by DTC) is our responsibility.
Disbursement of payments to participants is the responsibility of DTC, and
disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of
participants.

  

Other than in the circumstances described herein, a beneficial owner will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Bonds. Accordingly, each
beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights
under the Bonds.

  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with
respect to the Bonds at any time by giving us reasonable notice. In the event
no successor securities depositary is obtained, certificates for the Bonds
will be printed and delivered. We may decide to replace DTC or any successor
depositary. Additionally, subject to the procedures of DTC, we may decide to
discontinue use of the system of book‑entry transfers through DTC (or a
successor depositary) with respect to some or all of the Bonds. In that event
or if an event of default with respect to the Bonds has occurred and is
continuing, certificates for the Bonds of such series will be printed and
delivered. If certificates for the Bonds are printed and delivered,

  

•those Bonds will be issued in fully registered form without coupons;

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to exchange those Bonds, without
charge, for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the same series,
having the same issue date and with identical terms and provisions; and

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to transfer those Bonds without
cost to another holder, other than for applicable stamp taxes or other
governmental charges.

  

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book‑entry system has
been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

issued under the Mortgage, including the 2066 Bonds, are referred to herein as
“Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds.” As summarized below, the Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds have and will have the benefit of the lien of two mortgage
indentures (the “Class A Mortgages”) to the extent of the aggregate principal
amount of first mortgage bonds (the “Class A Bonds”) issued under the Class A
Mortgages held by the Trustee and the lien of the Mortgage on our Mortgaged
Property (as described below).

  

The Mortgage, including Officer’s Certificate 6-B-5, dated August 10, 2016,
which established the terms of the 2066 Bonds (the “Officer’s Certificate”),
and the Class A Mortgages contain the full legal texts of the matters
described herein. Because this is a summary, it does not describe every aspect
of the Mortgage, the Class A Mortgages, the supplemental indentures relating
to the 2066 Bonds and the related Class A Bonds, the Officer’s Certificate,
the outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, including the 2066 Bonds, or
the Class A Bonds, including those issued in connection with the 2066 Bonds.
The Mortgage, the Officer’s Certificate, the Class A Mortgages, and the
officer’s certificates and the supplemental indentures that relate to the
outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds and bonds under the Class A
Mortgages, including the 2066 Bonds and the related Class A Bonds, are filed
as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this is filed as an
exhibit. You should read these documents for provisions that may be important
to you. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference
to all the provisions of the Mortgage and the Class A Mortgages, including the
definitions of some of the terms used in the Mortgage and the Class A
Mortgages, and to the particular terms of the Officer’s Certificate. We also
include references in parentheses to some of the sections of the Mortgage.

  

* * *

  

The Mortgage and the Class A Mortgages have been qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, and you should also refer to the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 for provisions that apply to the 2066 Bonds.

  

General

  

The Mortgage permits us to issue Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds from time to
time subject to the limitations described under “—Issuance of Additional
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds.” All Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any
one series need not be issued at the same time, and a series may be reopened
for issuances of additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of that series.
This means that we may from time to time, without the consent of the existing
holders of the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any series, including the
2066 Bonds, create and issue additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of a
series having the same terms and conditions as the previously issued
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of that series in all respects, except for
issue date, issue price and, if applicable, the initial interest payment on
those additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds. Additional Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds issued in this manner will be consolidated with, and will form
a single series with, the previously issued Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of
that series. For more information, see the discussion below under “—Issuance
of Additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds.”

  

Other than the security afforded by the lien of the Mortgage and restrictions
on the issuance of additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds described above,
there are no provisions of the Mortgage that grant the holders of the
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction involving us.

  

Redemption

  

At any time on or after September 1, 2021, we may redeem the 2066 Bonds prior
to maturity, in whole or in part, at our option, on not less than 30 days’ nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the 2066 Bonds being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Unless the 2066
Bonds are held in book-entry only form through the facilities of The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), in which case DTC’s procedures for selection
shall apply (see “—Book-Entry Only Securities”), if less than all of the 2066
Bonds are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the 2066 Bonds to be
redeemed. (Mortgage, Section 503.)

  

Unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest,
if any, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the 2066 Bonds
subject to such notice of redemption will cease to bear interest on the
redemption date. (Mortgage, Section 505.) We will pay the redemption price and
any accrued interest to the redemption date upon surrender of any 2066 Bond
for redemption. (Mortgage, Section 505.) If only part of a 2066 Bond is
redeemed, the Trustee will deliver to the holder of the 2066 Bond a new 2066
Bond for the remaining portion at our expense. (Mortgage, Section 506.)

  

We may make any redemption at our option conditional upon the receipt by the
paying agent, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money
sufficient to pay the redemption price and accrued interest, if any. If the
paying agent has not received the money by the date fixed for redemption, we
will not be required to redeem the 2066 Bonds. (Mortgage, Section 504.)

  

Payment and Paying Agents

  

Interest on the 2066 Bonds accrues at the rate of 4.875% per year. Interest
started to accrue from the date that the 2066 Bonds were issued. Interest
payments on the 2066 Bonds are made on March 1, June 1, September 1 and
December 1 of each year. As long as the 2066 Bonds are registered in the name

  

* * *

  

of DTC or its nominee, the record date for interest payable on any interest
payment date shall be the close of business on the Business Day (defined as
any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which banking
institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or
executive order to remain closed or a day on which the corporate trust office
of the Trustee is closed for business) immediately preceding such interest
payment date. We have agreed to pay interest on any overdue principal and, if
such payment is enforceable under applicable law, on any overdue installment
of interest on the 2066 Bonds at a rate of 4.875% per year, to holders of
record at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding our
payment of such interest.

  

Interest on the 2066 Bonds is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months. If any interest payment date or the maturity date of the
2066 Bonds falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on that
interest payment date or the maturity date will be made on the next Business
Day and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay.

  

If there has been a default in the payment of interest on the 2066 Bonds, the
defaulted interest may be paid to the holders as of the close of business on a
date between 10 and 15 days before the date proposed by us for payment of the
defaulted interest (and not less than 10 days after the Trustee receives
notice of our proposal) or in any other manner permitted by any securities
exchange on which the 2066 Bonds may be listed, if the Trustee finds it
practicable. (Mortgage, Section 307.)

  

The principal amount of the 2066 Bonds and interest thereon is and will be
paid in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time
of payment is legal tender at the corporate trust office of The Bank of New
York Mellon in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, as our
paying agent. However, we may choose to make payment of interest by check
mailed to the address of the persons entitled to payment as they may appear or
have appeared in the security register for the 2066 Bonds. We may change the
place of payment on the 2066 Bonds, appoint one or more additional paying
agents (including us) and remove any paying agent, all at our discretion.
(Mortgage, Section 702.)

  

As long as the 2066 Bonds are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, we
will pay principal and interest due on the 2066 Bonds to DTC. DTC will then
make payment to its participants for disbursement to the beneficial owners of
the 2066 Bonds as described under the heading “—Book-Entry Only Securities.”

  

Form and Exchange

  

The 2066 Bonds are fully-registered bonds without coupons, issued in
denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. The 2066
Bonds are represented by a global certificate without coupons registered in
the name of a nominee of DTC.

  

The transfer of 2066 Bonds may be registered, and 2066 Bonds may be exchanged
for other 2066 Bonds of authorized denominations and with the same terms and
principal amount, at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of
New York. (Mortgage, Section 305.) We may, upon prompt written notice to the
Trustee and the holders of the 2066 Bonds, designate one or more additional
places, or change the place or places previously designated, for registration
of transfer and exchange of the 2066 Bonds. (Mortgage, Section 702.) No
service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of
the 2066 Bonds. However, we may require payment to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with a registration of
transfer or exchange of the 2066 Bonds. We will not be required to execute or
to provide for the registration of transfer or exchange of any 2066 Bond:

  

•during the 15 days before an interest payment date;

  

* * *

  

•during the 15 days before giving any notice of redemption; or

•selected for redemption except the unredeemed portion of any 2066 Bond being
redeemed in part.

  

(Mortgage, Section 305.)

  

Security

  

The Mortgage imposes a lien on all of our tangible electric and gas utility
property located in Louisiana, whether real, personal or mixed, together with
our franchises, permits and licenses that are transferable and necessary for
the operation of such property and our recorded easements and rights of way
and our electric utility properties located in Union County, Arkansas and
certain related properties, in each case, other than Excepted Property (as
defined below) and subject to Permitted Liens (as defined below). These
properties are sometimes referred to as our “Mortgaged Property.”

  

The 2066 Bonds, together with all other Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds now or
in the future outstanding under the Mortgage, have and will have the equal and
ratable benefit of: (1) the first mortgage lien of each Class A Mortgage on
the part of the Mortgaged Property covered thereby, as described below, to the
extent of the aggregate principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under such
Class A Mortgage held by the Trustee, subject to liens permitted under such
Class A Mortgage, and (2) the first mortgage lien of the Mortgage on any of
our Mortgaged Property that is not subject to the lien of any Class A
Mortgage, subject to Permitted Liens. In addition, the 2066 Bonds, together
with all other Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds now or in the future
outstanding under the Mortgage, have and will have the equal and ratable
benefit of a second mortgage lien on all of our Mortgaged Property that is
subject to the lien of a Class A Mortgage, subject to Permitted Liens. To the
extent that any Class A Bonds do not bear interest, which is permissible under
the Mortgage, holders of the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds do not have the
benefit of the lien of the related Class A Mortgage in respect of an amount
equal to the accrued interest, if any, on the related Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds (but would have the benefit of the first mortgage lien of the
related Class A Mortgage in respect of an amount equal to the principal of the
related Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds and the benefit of the second mortgage
lien of the Mortgage in respect of an amount equal to the principal of, and
any accrued interest or premium on, the related Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds).

  

Class A Bonds

  

Class A Bonds are first mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under either of
our Class A Mortgages. We currently have two Class A Mortgages: our Indenture
of Mortgage dated September 1, 1926 (as restated, amended and supplemented,
the “EGSL Mortgage”) and our Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of April 1,
1944 (as amended and supplemented, the “ELL Mortgage”). The Class A Bonds
issued under the ELL Mortgage are and will be secured by a first mortgage lien
(subject to liens permitted by the ELL Mortgage) on substantially all of our
Mortgaged Property that was owned by us just before the merger of Entergy Gulf
States Power, LLC (“EGSP LLC”) into us on October 1, 2015, together with
replacements, additions and extensions of or to such property acquired by us.
The Class A Bonds issued under the EGSL Mortgage are and will be secured by a
first mortgage lien (subject to liens permitted by the EGSL Mortgage) on
substantially all of our Mortgaged Property that was owned by EGSP LLC just
before its merger into us, together with substitutions, replacements,
additions and extensions of or to such property acquired by us. Neither Class
A Mortgage will cover additional property acquired by us after the date of the
aforesaid merger except property that constitutes a replacement, addition or
extension of the property covered by such Class A Mortgage. If we merge or
consolidate with an entity that has a first mortgage indenture on its
property, we may designate that mortgage indenture as an additional Class A
Mortgage.

  

  

* * *

  

If the Trustee holds all of the Class A Bonds outstanding under a particular
Class A Mortgage, we may discharge that Class A Mortgage, and the lien of the
Mortgage will become a first mortgage lien on the Mortgaged Property that was
subject to that Class A Mortgage, subject only to Permitted Liens. As of
December 31, 2020, we had approximately $6,319 million principal amount of
Class A Bonds outstanding under the ELL Mortgage and approximately $2,278
million principal amount of Class A Bonds outstanding under the EGSL Mortgage.

  

Permitted Liens

  

The lien of the Mortgage is subject to permitted liens described in the
Mortgage (the “Permitted Liens”). These Permitted Liens include, among others,

  

•liens existing at November 1, 2015 (the “Execution Date”), that have not been
discharged, including the liens of the Class A Mortgages;

•as to property acquired by us after the Execution Date, liens existing or
placed on such property at the time we acquire such property, including the
liens of any Class A Mortgages and any purchase money liens;

•tax liens, assessments and other governmental charges or requirements which
are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•mechanics’, workmen’s, repairmen’s, materialmen’s, warehousemen’s and
carriers’ liens, other liens incident to construction, liens or privileges of
any of our employees for salary or wages earned, but not yet payable, and
other liens, including liens for worker’s compensation awards, arising in the
ordinary course of business for charges or requirements which are not
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not been given
to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to receive
such notices;

•specified judgment liens and prepaid liens;

•easements, leases, reservations or other rights of others (including
governmental entities) in, and defects of title in, our property;

•liens securing indebtedness or other obligations relating to real property we
acquired for specified transmission, distribution or communication purposes or
for the purpose of obtaining rights-of-way;

•specified leases and leasehold, license, franchise and permit interests;

•liens resulting from laws, rules, regulations, orders or rights of
Governmental Authorities and specified liens required by law or governmental
regulations;

•liens to secure public or statutory obligations;

•rights of others to take minerals, timber, electric energy or capacity, gas,
water, steam or other products produced by us or by others on our property;

•rights and interests of persons other than us arising out of agreements
relating to the common ownership or joint use of property, and liens on the
interests of those persons in the property;

•restrictions on assignment and/or requirements of any assignee to qualify as
a permitted assignee and/or public utility or public services corporation; and

•liens which have been bonded for the full amount in dispute or for the
payment of which other adequate security arrangements have been made.

•

(Mortgage, Granting Clauses and Section 101.)

  

The Mortgage provides that the Trustee has a lien, prior to the lien on the
Mortgaged Property securing the 2066 Bonds, for the payment of its reasonable
compensation and expenses and for indemnity

  

* * *

  

against specified liabilities. (Mortgage, Section 1007.) This lien would be a
Permitted Lien under the Mortgage.

  

The first mortgage liens of the Class A Mortgages are subject to similar,
although not identical, permitted liens.

  

Excepted Property

  

The lien of the Mortgage does not cover, among other things, the following
types of property:

  

•all cash, deposit accounts, securities and all policies of insurance on the
lives of our officers not paid or delivered to or deposited with or held by
the Trustee or required so to be;

•all contracts, leases, operating agreements and other agreements of all kinds
and rights thereunder (other than our franchises, permits and licenses that
are transferable and necessary for the operation of the Mortgaged Property),
bills, notes and other instruments, revenues, income and earnings, all
accounts, accounts receivable, rights to payment, payment intangibles and
unbilled revenues, rights created by statute or governmental action to bill
and collect revenues or other amounts from customers or others, credits,
claims, demands and judgments;

•all governmental and other licenses, permits, franchises, consents and
allowances (other than our franchises, permits and licenses that are
transferable and necessary for the operation of Mortgaged Property);

•all unrecorded easements and rights of way;

•all intellectual property rights and other general intangibles;

•all vehicles, movable equipment, aircraft and vessels and all parts,
accessories and supplies used in connection with any of the foregoing;

•all personal property of such character that the perfection of a security
interest therein or other lien thereon is not governed by the Uniform
Commercial Code in effect where we are organized;

•all merchandise and appliances acquired for the purpose of resale in the
ordinary course and conduct of our business, any nuclear fuel and all fuel,
materials and supplies held for consumption in use or operation of any of our
properties or held in advance of use thereof for fixed capital purposes;

•all electric energy and capacity, gas, steam and other materials and products
generated, manufactured, produced or purchased by us for sale, distribution or
use in the ordinary course and conduct of our business;

•all property that is the subject of a lease agreement designating us as
lessee, and all our right, title and interest in and to the property and in,
to and under the lease agreement, whether or not the lease agreement is
intended as security; and the last day of the term of any lease or leasehold
which may become subject to the lien of the Mortgage;

•all property, real, personal and mixed, that has been released from the lien
of any Class A Mortgage, whether before or after the Execution Date, and any
improvements, extensions and additions to such property and renewals,
replacements, substitutions of or for any parts thereof;

•all timber, minerals, mineral rights and royalties;

•all natural gas wells, natural gas leases, natural gas lines or other
property used in the production of natural gas or in the transmission of
natural gas up to the point of connection with any gas distribution system
owned by us (other than any transmission system or systems used for the
transmission of natural gas between any gas distribution systems owned by us);
and

•all property, real, personal and mixed, that, after the Execution Date, has
been released from the lien of the Mortgage, and any improvements, extensions
and additions to such property and renewals, replacements, substitutions of or
for any parts thereof.

  

  

* * *

  

We sometimes refer to property of ours not covered by the lien of the Mortgage
as “Excepted Property.” (Mortgage, Granting Clauses.)

  

The Class A Mortgages have similar, although not identical, exceptions to the
property subject thereto.

  

Funded Property

  

The Mortgaged Property that is owned by us at any particular time is sometimes
referred to as “Property Additions.” Property Additions will be or become
Funded Property:

  

•when designated by us to be funded in connection with the discharge of a
Class A Mortgage; or

•when used under the Mortgage for the issuance of Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds, the release or retirement of Funded Property, or the withdrawal of
funded cash deposited with the Trustee.

  

(Mortgage, Section 102.)

  

Issuance of Additional Bonds

  

Issuance of Additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds

Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any series may be issued from time to time,
subject to the limitation that the aggregate principal amount of Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds issued under the Mortgage at any one time outstanding
shall not exceed $200 billion, on the basis of:

  

•the aggregate principal amount of Class A Bonds (which need not bear
interest) issued to the Trustee;

•70% of the cost or fair value to us (whichever is less) of Property Additions
that do not constitute Funded Property after specified deductions and
additions, primarily including adjustments to offset property retirements;

•the aggregate principal amount of Retired Securities, as defined below; or

•an amount of cash deposited with the Trustee.

•

(Mortgage, Sections 102, 1601, 1602, 1603, 1604 and 1605.)

  

“Retired Securities” means any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds authenticated
and delivered under the Mortgage which:

  

•no longer remain outstanding;

•have not been made the basis of the authentication and delivery of Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds, the release of Mortgaged Property or the withdrawal of
funded cash; and

•have not been paid, redeemed, purchased or otherwise retired by the
application thereto of funded cash.

  

(Mortgage, Section 101.)

  

Issuance of Additional Class A Bonds

  

The maximum principal amount of bonds that may be issued under the ELL
Mortgage is limited to $100 billion at any time outstanding under the ELL
Mortgage, subject to property additions and other limitations of the ELL
Mortgage. Class A Bonds may be issued from time to time under the ELL Mortgage
on the basis of:

  

* * *

  

  

•80% of the cost or fair value, whichever is less, of unfunded property
additions after adjustments to offset retirements;

•retirements of bonds issued under the ELL Mortgage or qualified lien bonds;
or

•deposit of cash with the trustee under the ELL Mortgage.

  

Property additions under the ELL Mortgage generally include the Mortgaged
Property that was acquired by us after December 31, 1943 and was owned by us
just before the merger of EGSP LLC into us, together with replacements,
additions and extensions of or to such property acquired by us. Unfunded
property additions are generally those that have not been used under the ELL
Mortgage to issue bonds, release property, withdraw cash or replace retired
property that has been used for such purposes.

  

Class A Bonds may be issued from time to time under the EGSL Mortgage, subject
to the limitation that the aggregate principal amount of bonds issued under
the EGSL Mortgage at any one time outstanding shall not exceed $100 billion,
on the basis of:

  

•an amount not exceeding 60% of available net additions;

•available debt retirements of bonds and/or refundable indebtedness under the
EGSL Mortgage; or

•the deposit of cash with the trustee under the EGSL Mortgage.

  

Net additions under the EGSL Mortgage generally include the Mortgaged Property
that was owned by EGSP LLC just before its merger into us, together with
substitutions, replacements, additions and extensions of or to such property
acquired by us. Available net additions are generally net additions that have
not been used under the EGSL Mortgage to issue bonds, release property,
withdraw cash or replace retired property that has been used for such
purposes.

  

As a condition to the authentication and delivery of bonds under the EGSL
Mortgage on the basis of property additions and (with certain exceptions) on
the basis of retired bonds, qualified lien bonds and/or refundable
indebtedness, the Company’s net earnings (as defined in the EGSL Mortgage) for
a recent period of twelve consecutive calendar months must have been at least
twice the annual interest requirements on all bonds outstanding under the EGSL
Mortgage including the new bonds.

  

As of December 31, 2020, we could have issued approximately $574 million
principal amount of additional Class A Bonds under the ELL Mortgage on the
basis of retired bonds, and we had approximately $610 million of unfunded
property additions, entitling us to issue approximately $488 million principal
amount of additional Class A Bonds under the ELL Mortgage on the basis of
property additions. As of December 31, 2020, we could have issued
approximately $2,214 million principal amount of additional Class A Bonds
under the EGSL Mortgage on the basis of available debt retirements, and we had
approximately $1,855 million of available net additions, entitling us to issue
approximately $1,113 million principal amount of additional Class A Bonds
under the EGSL Mortgage on the basis of available net additions (in each case,
assuming such additional Class A Bonds do not bear interest). As of December
31, 2020, we could have issued approximately $4,389 million principal amount
of additional Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds on the basis of Class A Bonds.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $6,319 million
principal amount of Class A Bonds outstanding under the ELL Mortgage and
approximately $2,278 million principal amount of Class A Bonds outstanding
under the EGSL Mortgage.

  

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $6,299 million aggregate
principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds outstanding. As of
December 31, 2020, we had approximately $666 million of unfunded property
additions under the Mortgage, entitling us to issue approximately $466 million
principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds on the basis of property
additions. As of

  

* * *

  

December 31, 2020, we were not entitled to issue any Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds on the basis of retired Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds. Class A Bonds,
property additions and cash used as a basis for the issuance of Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds under the Mortgage from time to time will be for the
benefit of the holders of all Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds outstanding
under the Mortgage from time to time, including the holders of the 2066 Bonds.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the EGSL Mortgage without any consent or
other action by the holders of any bonds issued under the EGSL Mortgage
created on or after July 1, 2014, to remove the earnings coverage test
contained therein. In addition, each holder or future holder of Class A Bonds
issued under the EGSL Mortgage created on or after July 1, 2014 (including the
Trustee under the Mortgage), by its acquisition of an interest in such Class A
Bonds, irrevocably (a) consented or will consent to the amendment to the EGSL
Mortgage to remove the net earnings test without any further action and (b)
designated or will designate the trustee under the EGSL Mortgage as its proxy
with irrevocable instructions to vote in favor of such amendment or to deliver
a written consent thereto.

  

Release of Property

  

Special Release Provision – While Class A Mortgage is in Effect

  

Unless an event of default under the Mortgage has occurred and is continuing,
we may obtain the release from the lien of the Mortgage of any Mortgaged
Property that is subject to a Class A Mortgage by obtaining the release of
that property from the applicable Class A Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section 1808.)

  

Release of Property from Class A Mortgages

  

Properties subject to the lien of the ELL Mortgage may be released on the
basis of:

  

•the deposit of cash or purchase money mortgages;

•property additions, after adjustments in certain cases to offset retirements
and after making adjustments for qualified lien bonds, if any, outstanding
against property additions; and

•the aggregate principal amount of bonds that we would be entitled to issue
under the ELL Mortgage on the basis of retired qualified lien bonds; or (ii)
10/6ths of the aggregate principal amount of bonds that we would be entitled
to issue under the ELL Mortgage on the basis of retired bonds that were issued
prior to June 9, 2010; or (iii) 10/8ths of the aggregate principal amount of
bonds that we would be entitled to issue under the ELL Mortgage on the basis
of retired bonds that were issued after June 9, 2010; in each case with the
entitlement being waived by operation of the release.

  

Properties subject to the lien of the EGSL Mortgage may be released on the
basis of:

  

•the deposit of cash or, within certain limits, purchase money obligations
and, in certain cases, governmental or municipal obligations;

•the deposit of the proceeds of such properties with the holder of a prior
lien;

•available net additions; and

•available debt retirements of bonds or refundable indebtedness under the EGSL
Mortgage.

  

General Release Provisions

  

Unless an event of default under the Mortgage has occurred and is continuing,
we may obtain the release from the lien of the Mortgage of any Mortgaged
Property, except for funded cash, upon delivery to

  

* * *

  

the Trustee of an amount in cash equal to the amount, if any, as calculated by
us, by which the lower of the cost or fair value of the property to be
released exceeds the aggregate of:

  

•an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any obligations secured
by purchase money liens upon the property to be released and delivered to the
Trustee;

•an amount equal to the cost or fair value to us (whichever is less) of
Property Additions not constituting Funded Property after specified deductions
and additions, primarily including adjustments to offset property retirements
(except that these adjustments need not be made if the Property Additions were
acquired, made or constructed within the 90-day period preceding the release);

•10/7ths of the aggregate principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds
that we would be entitled to issue on the basis of Retired Securities or Class
A Bonds (with such entitlement being waived by operation of the release);

•any amount in cash and/or an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount
of any obligations secured by purchase money liens delivered to a holder of a
prior lien on Mortgaged Property in consideration for the release of such
Mortgaged Property from such prior lien; and

•any taxes and expenses incidental to any sale, exchange, dedication or other
disposition of the property to be released.

  

(Mortgage, Section 1803.)

  

Unless an event of default under the Mortgage has occurred and is continuing,
we may obtain the release from the lien of the Mortgage of any part of the
Mortgaged Property or any interest therein, which does not constitute Funded
Property or funded cash held by the Trustee, without depositing any cash or
property with the Trustee as long as (a) the aggregate amount of cost or fair
value to us (whichever is less) of all Property Additions which do not
constitute Funded Property (excluding the property to be released) after
specified deductions and additions, primarily including adjustments to offset
property retirements, is not less than zero or (b) the cost or fair value
(whichever is less) of property to be released does not exceed the aggregate
amount of the cost or fair value to us (whichever is less) of Property
Additions acquired, made or constructed within the 90-day period preceding the
release. (Mortgage, Section 1804.)

  

The Mortgage provides simplified procedures for the release of Mortgaged
Property with an aggregate cost or fair value (whichever is less) of up to the
greater of $10 million or 3% of the sum of outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds and Class A Bonds (other than Class A Bonds held by the
Trustee) during a calendar year and for the release of Mortgaged Property
taken or sold in connection with the power of eminent domain; the Mortgage
also provides for dispositions of certain obsolete or unnecessary Mortgaged
Property and for grants or surrender of certain easements, leases or rights of
way without any release or consent by the Trustee. (Mortgage, Sections 1802,
1805 and 1807.)

  

If we retain any interest in any property released from the lien of the
Mortgage, the Mortgage will not become a lien on that property or the interest
in that property or any improvements, extensions or additions to, or any
renewals, replacements or substitutions of or for, any part or parts of that
property unless we subject that property to the lien of the Mortgage.
(Mortgage, Section 1810.)

  

The Mortgage also provides that we may terminate, abandon, surrender, cancel,
release, modify or dispose of any of our franchises, permits or licenses that
are Mortgaged Property without any consent of the Trustee or the holders of
outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, provided that such action is, in
our opinion, necessary, desirable or advisable in the conduct of our business.
In addition, the Mortgage provides that, if any of our franchises, permits or
licenses that are Mortgaged Property because they are necessary for the
operation of other Mortgaged Property cease to be necessary, in our opinion,
for the

  

* * *

  

operation of the Mortgaged Property, such franchises, permits or licenses
shall automatically cease to be Mortgaged Property without any release or
consent, or report to, the Trustee. (Mortgage, Section 1802.)

  

Withdrawal of Cash

  

Unless an event of default under the Mortgage has occurred and is continuing,
and subject to specified limitations, cash held by the Trustee may generally,
(1) be withdrawn by us (a) to the extent of the cost or fair value to us
(whichever is less) of Property Additions not constituting Funded Property,
after specified deductions and additions, primarily including adjustments to
offset retirements (except that these adjustments need not be made if the
Property Additions were acquired, made or constructed within the 90-day period
preceding the withdrawal) or (b) in an amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds that we would be entitled to issue
on the basis of Retired Securities or Class A Bonds (with the entitlement to
the issuance being waived by operation of the withdrawal) or (c) in an amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of any outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds delivered to the Trustee (with the Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds being cancelled by the Trustee), or (2) upon our request, be applied to
(a) the purchase of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds or (b) the payment (or
provision for payment) at stated maturity of any Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds or the redemption (or provision for payment) prior to stated maturity of
any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds which are redeemable. (Mortgage, Section
1806.)

  

Satisfaction and Discharge of 2066 Bonds

  

Subject to certain conditions, the 2066 Bonds, or any portion of the 2066
Bonds, will be deemed paid and no longer outstanding under the Mortgage and we
can be discharged from our obligations on such 2066 Bonds, or such portion of
the 2066 Bonds, if we irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or any paying
agent, other than us, sufficient cash or government securities to pay the
principal, any interest and any other sums when due on such 2066 Bonds, or
such portion of such 2066 Bonds, on the stated maturity date or a redemption
date of the 2066 Bonds, or such portion of the 2066 Bonds. (Mortgage, Section
801.)

  

Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance of Assets

  

Under the terms of the Mortgage, we may not consolidate with or merge into any
other entity or convey, transfer or lease as, or substantially as, an entirety
to any entity the Mortgaged Property, unless:

  

•the surviving or successor entity, or an entity that acquires by conveyance
or transfer or that leases our Mortgaged Property as, or substantially as, an
entirety, is organized and validly existing under the laws of any domestic
jurisdiction, and it expressly assumes our obligations on all Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds then outstanding and under the Mortgage and confirms the lien
of the Mortgage on the Mortgaged Property (as constituted immediately prior to
the time such transaction becomes effective), including subjecting to the lien
of the Mortgage all property thereafter acquired by the successor entity that
constitutes an improvement, extension or addition to the Mortgaged Property
(as so constituted) or a renewal, replacement or substitution of or for any
part thereof, but only to the extent that such improvement, extension or
addition is so affixed or attached to real property as to be regarded a part
of such real property or is an improvement, extension or addition to personal
property that is made to maintain, renew, repair or improve the function of
such personal property and is physically installed in or affixed to such
personal property;

•in the case of a lease, such lease is made expressly subject to termination
by us or by the Trustee and by the purchaser of the property so leased at any
sale thereof at any time during the continuance of an event of default under
the Mortgage;

  

* * *

  

•we shall have delivered to the Trustee an officer’s certificate and an
opinion of counsel as provided in the Mortgage; and

•immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any debt
that becomes an obligation of the successor entity as a result of such
transaction as having been incurred by the successor entity at the time of
such transaction), no event of default under the Mortgage, or event that,
after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an event of default under
the Mortgage, shall have occurred and be continuing.

  

(Mortgage, Section 1201.) In the case of the conveyance or other transfer of
the Mortgaged Property as, or substantially as, an entirety to another entity,
upon the satisfaction of all the conditions described above, we would be
released and discharged from all our obligations and covenants under the
Mortgage and on the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds then outstanding unless we
elect to waive such release and discharge. (Mortgage, Section 1204.)

  

The Mortgage does not prevent or restrict:

  

•any conveyance or other transfer, or lease, of any part of the Mortgaged
Property that does not constitute the entirety, or substantially the entirety,
of the Mortgaged Property; or (Mortgage, Section 1205.)

•any conveyance, transfer or lease of any of our properties where we retain
Mortgaged Property with a fair value in excess of 143% of the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, and any
other outstanding debt secured by a Class A Mortgage or a purchase money lien
that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds
with respect to the Mortgaged Property (other than Class A Bonds held by the
Trustee). This fair value will be determined within 90 days of the conveyance,
transfer or lease by an independent expert selected by us. (Mortgage, Section
1206.)

  

Although the successor entity may, in its sole discretion, subject to the lien
of the Mortgage property then owned or thereafter acquired by the successor
entity, the lien of the Mortgage generally will not cover the property of the
successor entity other than the mortgaged property it acquires from us and
improvements, extensions and additions to such property and renewals,
replacements and substitutions thereof, within the meaning of the Mortgage, as
described above. (Mortgage, Section 1203.)

  

The terms of the Mortgage do not restrict mergers in which we are the
surviving entity. (Mortgage, Section 1205.) A statutory merger pursuant to
which our assets and liabilities are allocated to one or more entities shall
not be considered to be a merger subject to the provisions of the Mortgage
described above unless all of our assets and liabilities are allocated to an
entity other than us and we do not survive such statutory merger. In all other
cases of a statutory merger pursuant to which any Mortgaged Property is
allocated to one or more entities other than us, each allocation of any
Mortgaged Property to an entity other than us shall be deemed, for purposes of
the Mortgage, to be a transfer of such Mortgaged Property to such entity and
not a merger. (Mortgage, Section 1207.)

  

Events of Default

  

Events of Default under the Mortgage

  

“Event of default,” when used in the Mortgage with respect to Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds, means any of the following:

  

  

* * *

  

•failure to pay interest on any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond for 30 days
after it is due unless we have made a valid extension of the interest payment
period with respect to such Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond as provided in the
Mortgage;

•failure to pay the principal of or any premium on any Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bond when due unless we have made a valid extension of the maturity
of such Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond as provided in the Mortgage;

•failure to perform or breach of any other covenant or warranty in the
Mortgage that continues for 90 days after we receive written notice from the
Trustee, or we and the Trustee receive written notice from the holders of at
least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds, unless the Trustee, or the Trustee and the holders of a
principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds not less than the
principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds the holders of which gave
such notice, as the case may be, agree in writing to an extension of such
period prior to its expiration; provided, however, that the Trustee, or the
Trustee and the holders of such principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have agreed to an extension of
such period if corrective action is initiated by us within such period and is
being diligently pursued;

•events of our bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization as specified in the
Mortgage;

•so long as the Trustee holds any Class A Bonds under the Mortgage
corresponding to outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, any matured
event of default under the applicable Class A Mortgage resulting in
acceleration of such Class A Bonds; provided that any cure or waiver of such
event of default and any rescission or annulment of such acceleration under
the applicable Class A Mortgage shall constitute a cure, waiver, rescission or
annulment under the Mortgage; or

•any other event of default included in any supplemental indenture, board
resolution or officer’s certificate establishing a series of Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds.

•

(Mortgage, Sections 301, 901 and 1301.)

  

The Trustee is required to give notice of any default under the Mortgage known
to the Trustee in the manner and to the extent required to do so by the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, unless such default shall have been cured or waived.
However, in the case of any default of the character specified in the third
bullet in the preceding paragraph, no such notice to holders of the Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds shall be given until at least 60 days after the
occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall give to the trustee under each Class A
Mortgage a copy of each notice of default given to the holders of Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds. In addition, the Trustee shall give to the holders of
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds copies of each notice of default under any
Class A Mortgage given to the Trustee in its capacity as owner and holder of
Class A Bonds under that Class A Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section 1002.)

  

So long as the Trustee holds any Class A Bonds under the Mortgage
corresponding to outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, such Class A
Bonds shall be redeemed by us, in whole at any time, or in part from time to
time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof, upon
receipt by the trustee under the related Class A Mortgage of a written notice
from the Trustee to us and such trustee stating that an Event of Default under
the Mortgage has occurred and is continuing and that, as a result, there is
due and payable a specified amount with respect to such Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds, for the payment of which the Trustee has not received funds
and specifying the principal amount of such Class A Bonds to be redeemed.

  

Events of Default under the Class A Mortgages

  

Events of default under the existing Class A Mortgages include default in
payment of principal or premium, if any, when due; default, for 60 days under
the ELL Mortgage and 30 days under the EGSL Mortgage, in the payment of
interest; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; and

  

* * *

  

default in other covenants for 90 days after notice by the trustee or the
holders of a specified percentage of bonds outstanding under the applicable
Class A Mortgage.

  

Remedies

  

Acceleration of Maturity

  

If an event of default under the Mortgage occurs and is continuing, then the
Trustee, by written notice to us, or the holders of at least 33% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, by
written notice the Trustee and us, may declare the principal amount of all of
the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds to be due and payable immediately, and
upon our receipt of such notice, such principal amount, together with premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest will become immediately due and
payable. (Mortgage, Section 902.)

  

There is no automatic acceleration, even in the event of our bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization.

  

Rescission of Acceleration

  

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made but before
any sale of the Mortgaged Property and before a judgment or decree for payment
of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the event of default under
the Mortgage giving rise to such declaration of acceleration will be
considered cured, and such declaration and its consequences will be considered
rescinded and annulled, if:

  

•we have paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

a.all overdue interest on all outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds;

b.the principal of and premium, if any, on the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration and overdue interest thereon;

c.interest on overdue interest, if any, to the extent lawful; and

d.all amounts due to the Trustee under the Mortgage; and

•any other event of default under the Mortgage with respect to the Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bonds has been cured or waived as provided in the Mortgage.

  

(Mortgage, Section 902.)

  

Trustee Powers

  

Subject to the Mortgage, under specified circumstances and to the extent
permitted by law, if an event of default under the Mortgage occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee is entitled to the appointment of a receiver for the
Mortgaged Property and is entitled to all other remedies available to
mortgagees and secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code or any other
applicable law. (Mortgage, Section 916.) In addition, the Trustee may exercise
any right or remedy available to the Trustee as a holder of Class A Bonds
which arises as a result of a default or event of default under any Class A
Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section 917.)

  

Control by Holders

  

Other than its duties in the case of an event of default under the Mortgage,
the Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Mortgage at the request, order or direction of any of the holders, unless the
holders offer the Trustee an indemnity satisfactory to it. (Mortgage, Section
1003.) If an event of default under the Mortgage has occurred and is
continuing and they provide this

  

* * *

  

indemnity, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds will have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Trustee is not obligated to comply with directions that conflict with law or
other provisions of the Mortgage or that could involve the Trustee in personal
liability in circumstances where indemnity would not, in the Trustee’s sole
discretion, be adequate. (Mortgage, Section 912.)

  

Limitation on Holders’ Right to Institute Proceedings

  

No holder of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds will have any right to institute
any proceeding under the Mortgage or the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, or
any remedy under or with respect to the Mortgage or the Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds, unless:

  

•the holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing
event of default under the Mortgage;

•the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of all series have made a written request to
the Trustee and have offered indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee to
institute proceedings; and

•the Trustee has failed to institute any proceeding for 60 days after notice
and has not received during that period any direction from the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds inconsistent with the written request of holders referred to
above;

  

provided that no holder or holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds shall
have any right in any manner to affect or prejudice the rights of other
holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds or to obtain priority over such
other holders. (Mortgage, Section 907.) However, these limitations do not
apply to the absolute and unconditional right of a holder of a Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bond to institute suit for payment of the principal, premium,
if any, or interest on the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond on or after the
applicable due date. (Mortgage, Section 908.)

  

Evidence to be Furnished to the Trustee

  

Compliance with the Mortgage provisions is evidenced by written statements of
our officers or persons we select or pay. In certain cases, opinions of
counsel and certifications of an engineer, accountant, appraiser or other
expert (who in some cases must be independent) must be furnished. We must give
the Trustee an annual certificate as to whether or not we have fulfilled our
obligations under the Mortgage throughout the preceding year. (Mortgage,
Section 705.)

  

Modification and Waiver

  

Modification Without Consent

  

Without the consent of any holder of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, we and
the Trustee may enter into one or more supplemental indentures for any of the
following purposes:

  

•to evidence the assumption by any permitted successor of our covenants in the
Mortgage and in the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds;

•to add one or more covenants or other provisions for the benefit of the
holders of all or any series or tranche of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, or
to surrender any right or power conferred upon us;

  

* * *

  

•to add additional events of default under the Mortgage for all or any series
of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds;

•to change, eliminate or add any provision to the Mortgage; provided, however,
if the change, elimination or addition will adversely affect the interests of
the holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any series in any material
respect, the change, elimination or addition will become effective only:

1.when the consent of the holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of such
series has been obtained in accordance with the Mortgage; or

2.when no Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of the affected series remain
outstanding under the Mortgage;

•to provide additional security for any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds;

•to establish the form or terms of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any
other series as permitted by the Mortgage;

•to provide for the authentication and delivery of bearer securities with or
without coupons;

•to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a separate or
successor Trustee or co-trustee;

•to provide for the procedures required for us to use a noncertificated system
of registration for the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of all or any series;

•to change any place where principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be
payable, Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds may be surrendered for registration
of transfer or exchange, and notices and demands to us may be served;

•to amend and restate the Mortgage as originally executed and as amended from
time to time, with additions, deletions and other changes that do not
adversely affect the interests of the holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds of any series in any material respect;

•to cure any ambiguity or inconsistency or to make any other changes or
additions to the provisions of the Mortgage if such changes or additions will
not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds of any series in any material respect; or

•to increase or decrease the maximum amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds
that may be outstanding at any one time under the Mortgage to an amount that
is not less than the aggregate principal amount of Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds then outstanding.

  

(Mortgage, Section 1301.)

  

Modification and Waiver Requiring Consent

  

Except as provided below, the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bonds, considered as one class, is required for all other amendments or
modifications to the Mortgage. However, if less than all of the series of
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds outstanding are directly affected by a
proposed amendment or modification, then the consent of the holders of only a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds of all series that are directly affected, considered as one
class, will be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or
modification may be made without the consent of the holder of each directly
affected Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond then outstanding to:

  

•change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of
principal of or interest on, any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond, or reduce the
principal amount of any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond or its rate of interest
or change the method of calculating that interest rate or reduce any premium
payable upon redemption, or change the currency in which payments are made, or
impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or
after the stated maturity of any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond;

  

* * *

  

•create any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Mortgage
with respect to the Mortgaged Property, terminate the lien of the Mortgage on
the Mortgaged Property or deprive any holder of a Collateral Trust Mortgage
Bond of the benefits of the security of the lien of the Mortgage;

•reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds of any series the consent of the holders of which is required
for any amendment or modification or any waiver of compliance with a provision
of the Mortgage or of any default thereunder and its consequences, or reduce
the requirements thereunder for a quorum or voting; or

•modify certain provisions of the Mortgage relating to supplemental
indentures, waivers of some covenants and waivers of past defaults with
respect to the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any series.

  

A supplemental indenture that changes the Mortgage solely for the benefit of
one or more particular series of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, or modifies
the rights of the holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of one or more
series, will not affect the rights under the Mortgage of the holders of the
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds of any other series. (Mortgage, Section 1302.)

  

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of then outstanding
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds, considered as one class, may waive compliance
by us with some restrictive provisions of the Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section
706.) The holders of a majority in principal amount of then outstanding
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds may waive any past default under the Mortgage,
except a default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on
any outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds and certain covenants and
provisions of the Mortgage that cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the holder of each outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond of
any affected series. (Mortgage, Section 913.)

  

The Mortgage provides that Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds owned by us or
anyone else required to make payment on the Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds
shall be disregarded and considered not to be outstanding in determining
whether the required holders have given a request or consent. (Mortgage,
Section 101.)

  

We may fix in advance a record date to determine the holders entitled to give
any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
similar act of the holders, but we have no obligation to do so. If we fix a
record date, that request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other act of the holders may be given before or after that record
date, but only the holders of record at the close of business on that record
date will be considered holders for the purposes of determining whether
holders of the required percentage of the outstanding Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds have authorized or agreed or consented to the request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other act of the holders.
For that purpose, the outstanding Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds will be
computed as of the record date.

  

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election,
waiver or other act of a holder of any Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond will
bind every future holder of that Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond and the holder
of every Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond issued upon the registration of
transfer of or in exchange for that Collateral Trust Mortgage Bond. A
transferee will also be bound by acts of the Trustee or us in reliance
thereon, whether or not notation of that action is made upon the Collateral
Trust Mortgage Bond. (Mortgage, Section 106.)

  

Voting of Class A Bonds

  

  

* * *

  

The Mortgage provides that the Trustee will, as holder of Class A Bonds
delivered as the basis for the issuance of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds,
attend meetings of holders of bonds under the related Class A Mortgage, or
deliver its proxy in connection with those meetings, that relate to matters
with respect to which it, as a holder, is entitled to vote or consent. The
Mortgage provides that, so long as no event of default under the Mortgage has
occurred and is continuing and except for the rights and remedies of the
Trustee in case of a default or matured event of default under a Class A
Mortgage, the Trustee will, as holder of the Class A Bonds, vote or consent
(without any consent or other action by the holders of the Collateral Trust
Mortgage Bonds, except as described in the proviso of clause (2) below) in
favor of any amendments or modifications to the applicable Class A Mortgage as
follows:

  

1.to conform any provision of a Class A Mortgage in all material respects to
the correlative provision of the Mortgage, to add to a Class A Mortgage any
provision not otherwise contained therein which conforms in all material
respects to a provision contained in the Mortgage, to delete from a Class A
Mortgage any provision to which the Mortgage contains no correlative provision
and any combination of the foregoing and/or, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, to effect certain amendments included in supplemental
indentures to the ELL Mortgage and the EGSL Mortgage; and/or;

2.with respect to any amendments or modifications to any Class A Mortgage
other than those amendments or modifications referred to in clause (1) above,
vote all the Class A Bonds delivered under such Class A Mortgage, or consent
with respect thereto, proportionately with the vote or consent of holders of
all other Class A Bonds outstanding under such Class A Mortgage the holders of
which are eligible to vote or consent, as evidenced by a certificate delivered
by the trustee under such Class A Mortgage; provided, however, that the
Trustee will not vote in favor of, or consent to, any amendment or
modification of a Class A Mortgage which, if it were an amendment or
modification of the Mortgage, would require the consent of holders of
Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds as described under “—Modification and Waiver,”
without the prior consent of holders of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds which
would be required for an amendment or modification of the Mortgage.

  

(Mortgage, Section 1705.)

  

We may make amendments to, or eliminate some of the covenants in, the ELL
Mortgage with the consent of the holders of a majority of the bonds
outstanding under the ELL Mortgage considered as one class, provided that, if
less than all series of such bonds are affected, only the consent of holders
of a majority of such bonds of each series affected, considered as one class,
is required for such modification, but no such modification shall, without the
consent of the holder of any such bond affected by such modification, permit:

  

•the extension of the maturity or reduction of the principal of or interest on
such bond or other modification in the terms of payment of such principal or
interest;

•the creation of a lien that is prior or equal to the lien of the ELL Mortgage
with respect to the mortgaged property under the ELL Mortgage or the
deprivation of any non-assenting holder of such bonds of the benefit of a lien
on the mortgaged property under the ELL Mortgage (subject only to excepted
encumbrances as defined in the ELL Mortgage); or

•the reduction of the percentage required for modification of the ELL
Mortgage.

  

We may make amendments to, or eliminate some of the covenants in, the EGSL
Mortgage with the consent of the holders of not less than 75% in aggregate
principal amount of the bonds outstanding under the EGSL Mortgage, including
not less than 60% of each series affected, but no such modification shall:

  

  

* * *

  

•extend the maturity of any such bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time
of payment of interest on any such bonds or reduce the amount of principal of
any such bonds, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption of any such
bonds, without the consent of the holder of such affected bond;

•permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a
parity with the lien of the EGSL Mortgage, without the consent of the holders
of all the bonds then outstanding under the EGSL Mortgage; or

•reduce the above-described percentage of holders of bonds under the EGSL
Mortgage required to approve any such modification, without the consent of the
holders of all such bonds then outstanding.

  

If we amend a Class A Mortgage to eliminate one or more covenants as described
above, a holder of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds would no longer benefit
from such covenants.

  

Resignation of a Trustee; Removal

  

The Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice to us or may be
removed at any time by an act of the holders of a majority in principal amount
of Collateral Trust Mortgage Bonds then outstanding delivered to the Trustee
and us at least 31 days prior to such removal. No resignation or removal of
the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee will be effective until
the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee. So long as no event of
default or event that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an
event of default has occurred and is continuing and except with respect to a
Trustee appointed by act of the holders, if we have delivered to the Trustee a
board resolution appointing a successor Trustee and the successor has accepted
the appointment in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage, the Trustee will
be deemed to have resigned and the successor will be deemed to have been
appointed as Trustee in accordance with the Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section
1010.)

  

Notices

  

Notices to holders of 2066 Bonds are given by mail in writing to the addresses
of such holders as they may appear in the security register for the 2066
Bonds. (Mortgage, Section 108.)

  

Title

  

We, the Trustee, and any of our or the Trustee’s agents, may treat the person
in whose name 2066 Bonds are registered as the absolute owner thereof, whether
or not the 2066 Bonds may be overdue, for the purpose of making payments and
for all other purposes irrespective of notice to the contrary. (Mortgage,
Section 308.)

  

Governing Law

  

The Mortgage and the 2066 Bonds are governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its
conflicts of laws principles, except where otherwise required by law,
including with respect to the creation, perfection, priority or enforcement of
the lien of the Mortgage. (Mortgage, Section 114.)

  

Information about the Trustee

  

The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon. In addition to acting as Trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon also acts, and may act, as trustee under the ELL
Mortgage, the EGSL Mortgage, and various other of our and our affiliates’
indentures, trusts and guarantees. We and our affiliates maintain deposit

  

* * *

  

accounts and credit and liquidity facilities and conduct other banking
transactions with the Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of our
respective businesses.

  

Book-Entry Only Securities

  

The 2066 Bonds trade through DTC. The 2066 Bonds are represented by a global
certificate and registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee. The
global certificate was deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC.
Ownership of beneficial interests in the global certificate is limited to
institutions that have accounts with DTC or its participants or persons that
may hold interests through participants.

  

DTC is a New York clearing corporation and a clearing agency registered under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for its participants.
DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement of securities transactions
among its participants through electronic computerized book‑entry transfers
and pledges in the participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. The participants include
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by
the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Others who maintain a custodial
relationship with a participant can use the DTC system. The rules that apply
to DTC and those using its systems are on file with the SEC.

  

Purchases of the 2066 Bonds within the DTC system must be made through
participants, who will receive a credit for the 2066 Bonds on DTC’s records.
The beneficial ownership interest of each purchaser will be recorded on the
appropriate participant’s records. Beneficial owners do not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but beneficial owners should receive
written confirmations of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of
their holdings, from the participants through whom they purchased 2066 Bonds.
Transfers of ownership in the 2066 Bonds are to be accomplished by entries
made on the books of the participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners.
Beneficial owners will not receive certificates for their 2066 Bonds, except
if use of the book‑entry system for the 2066 Bonds is discontinued.

  

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all 2066 Bonds deposited by participants
with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit
of the 2066 Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co.
effects no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
beneficial owners of the 2066 Bonds. DTC’s records reflect only the identity
of the participants to whose accounts such 2066 Bonds are credited. These
participants may or may not be the beneficial owners. Participants are
responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their
customers.

  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, and by
participants to beneficial owners, are governed by arrangements among them,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time. Beneficial owners of 2066 Bonds may wish to take certain steps
to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect
to the 2066 Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults and proposed
amendments to the Mortgage. Beneficial owners of the 2066 Bonds may wish to
ascertain that the nominee holding the 2066 Bonds has agreed to obtain and
transmit notices to the beneficial owners.

  

  

* * *

  

Redemption notices will be sent to Cede & Co., as registered holder of the
2066 Bonds. If less than all of the 2066 Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s
practice is to determine by lot the amount of 2066 Bonds held by each
participant to be redeemed.

  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote with respect to 2066
Bonds, unless authorized by a participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures.
Under its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as
possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or
voting rights of Cede & Co. to those participants to whose accounts the 2066
Bonds are credited on the record date. We believe that these arrangements will
enable the beneficial owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the
rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the 2066
Bonds.

  

Payments of redemption proceeds, principal of, and interest on the 2066 Bonds
are and will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested
by DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt
of funds and corresponding detail information from us or our agent, on the
payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s
records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners are and will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Payments are the
responsibility of participants and not of DTC, the Trustee, or us, subject to
any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to
time. Payment of redemption proceeds, principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or
such other nominee as may be requested by DTC) is our responsibility.
Disbursement of payments to participants is the responsibility of DTC, and
disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of
participants.

  

Other than in the circumstances described herein, a beneficial owner will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of the 2066 Bonds. Accordingly, each
beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights
under the 2066 Bonds.

  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with
respect to the 2066 Bonds at any time by giving us reasonable notice. In the
event no successor securities depositary is obtained, certificates for the
2066 Bonds will be printed and delivered. We may decide to replace DTC or any
successor depositary. Additionally, subject to the procedures of DTC, we may
decide to discontinue use of the system of book‑entry transfers through DTC
(or a successor depositary) with respect to some or all of the 2066 Bonds. In
that event or if an event of default with respect the 2066 Bonds has occurred
and is continuing, certificates for the 2066 Bonds will be printed and
delivered. If certificates for the 2066 Bonds are printed and delivered,

  

•the 2066 Bonds will be issued in fully registered form without coupons;

•a holder of certificated 2066 Bonds would be able to exchange those 2066
Bonds, without charge, for an equal aggregate principal amount of 2066 Bonds
having the same issue date and with identical terms and provisions; and

•a holder of certificated 2066 Bonds would be able to transfer those 2066
Bonds without cost to another holder, other than for applicable stamp taxes or
other governmental charges.

  

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book‑entry system has
been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

Exhibit 4(e)2

DESCRIPTION OF ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, LLC’S SECURITIES

  

REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12

  

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

  

References in this exhibit to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Entergy Mississippi,
LLC.

  

We have issued, and may from time to time issue, bonds in one or more series
under one or more separate supplemental indentures to the Mortgage and Deed of
Trust dated as of February 1, 1988, with The Bank of New York Mellon,
successor trustee (the “trustee”). This Mortgage and Deed of Trust, as it has
heretofore been and may be amended or supplemented from time to time, is
referred to in this exhibit as the “mortgage.” All first mortgage bonds issued
or to be issued under the mortgage, including the Bonds (as defined below),
are referred to herein as “first mortgage bonds.”

  

As of February 26, 2021, we have one series of first mortgage bonds
outstanding that is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our First Mortgage Bonds, 4.90%
Series due October 1, 2066, issued in an aggregate principal amount of
$260,000,000 under the Thirty-Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
September 1, 2016, to the mortgage and traded on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker EMP (the “Bonds”).

  

The full aggregate principal amount of the Bonds is currently outstanding.

  

The mortgage, including the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the
Bonds, contains the full legal texts of the matters described herein. Because
this is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the mortgage, the
supplemental indenture relating to the Bonds, or the outstanding first
mortgage bonds, including the Bonds. The mortgage and the supplemental
indentures that relate to the outstanding first mortgage bonds, including the
Bonds, are filed as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this
is filed as an exhibit. You should read the mortgage for provisions that may
be important to you. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety
by reference to all the provisions of the mortgage, including the definitions
of some of the terms used in the mortgage, and to the particular terms of the
supplemental indenture that relates to the Bonds. The mortgage has been
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and you should also refer to
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 for provisions that apply to the Bonds.

  

General

  

The mortgage permits us to issue first mortgage bonds from time to time in an
unlimited aggregate amount subject to the limitations described below under
“Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds.” All first mortgage bonds of any
one series need not be issued at the same time, and a series may be reopened
for issuances of additional first mortgage bonds of that series. This means
that we may from time to time, without the consent of the existing holders of
the first mortgage bonds of any series, including the Bonds, create and issue
additional first mortgage bonds of a series having the same terms and
conditions as the previously issued first mortgage bonds of that series in all
respects, except for issue date, issue price and, if applicable, the initial
interest payment on those additional first mortgage bonds. Additional first
mortgage bonds issued in this manner will be consolidated with and will form a
single series with, the previously issued first mortgage bonds of that series.
For more information, see the discussion below under “Issuance of Additional
First Mortgage Bonds.”

  

  

* * *

  

Payment

  

The principal amount of the Bonds and interest thereon is and will be paid in
any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of
payment is legal tender at the corporate trust office of the trustee in the
Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York. Interest on the Bonds
accrues at the rate of 4.90% per year and started to accrue from the date that
the Bonds were issued. Interest payments on the Bonds are made on March 1,
June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year. As long as the Bonds are
registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee,
the record date for interest payable on any interest payment date shall be the
close of business on the Business Day (defined as any day other than a
Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New
York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or
a day on which the corporate trust office of the trustee is closed for
business) immediately preceding such interest payment date. We have agreed to
pay interest on any overdue principal and, if such payment is enforceable
under applicable law, on any overdue installment of interest on the Bonds at a
rate of 5.90% per year to holders of record at the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding our payment of such interest.

  

Interest on the Bonds is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months. If any interest payment date or the maturity date of the Bonds
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on that interest
payment date or the maturity date will be made on the next Business Day, and
without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay.

  

As long as the Bonds are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, we will
pay principal and interest due on the Bonds to DTC. DTC will then make payment
to its participants for disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Bonds as
described under the heading “Book-Entry Only Securities.”

  

Redemption and Retirement

  

At any time on or after October 1, 2021, we may redeem the Bonds prior to
maturity, in whole or in part, at our option, on not less than 30 days’ nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Bonds being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.

  

Unless the Bonds are held in book-entry only form through the facilities of
DTC, in which case DTC’s procedures for selection shall apply (see “Book-Entry
Only Securities”), if less than all of the Bonds are to be redeemed, the
trustee will select the Bonds to be redeemed.

  

Unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest,
if any, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Bonds
subject to such notice of redemption will cease to bear interest on the
redemption date. We will pay the redemption price and any accrued interest to
the redemption date upon presentation and surrender of any Bond for
redemption. If only part of a Bond is redeemed, the trustee will deliver to
the holder of the Bond a new Bond for the remaining portion without charge.

  

We may make any redemption at our option conditional upon the receipt by the
trustee, prior to the date fixed for redemption, of money sufficient to pay
the redemption price and accrued interest, if any. If the trustee has not
received the money by the date fixed for redemption, we will not be required
to redeem the Bonds.

  

Form and Exchange

  

  

* * *

  

The Bonds are fully-registered bonds without coupons, issued in denominations
of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. The Bonds are
represented by a global certificate without coupons registered in the name of
a nominee of DTC.

  

The Bonds are exchangeable for other Bonds in equal aggregate principal
amounts. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of the Bonds. However, we may require payment to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with a
registration of transfer or exchange. We will not be required to provide for
the transfer or exchange of any Bond:

  

1.during the 15 days before an interest payment date (unless such Bond has a
record date for the payment of interest),

2.during the 15 days before any designation of such Bond to be redeemed, or

3.selected for redemption.

  

Security

  

The Bonds, together with all other first mortgage bonds now or in the future
outstanding under the mortgage, are and will be secured, equally and ratably,
by the lien of the mortgage. The mortgage constitutes a first mortgage lien on
substantially all of our property (the “mortgaged property”) subject to
bankruptcy law and:

  

1.minor defects and encumbrances customarily found in similar properties that
do not materially impair the use of the mortgaged property in the conduct of
our business;

2.other liens, defects and encumbrances, if any, existing or created at the
time of our acquisition of the mortgaged property; and

3.excepted encumbrances.

  

  

The mortgage does not create a lien on the following “excepted property”:

1.cash and securities;

2.all merchandise, equipment, apparatus, materials or supplies held for sale
or other disposition in the usual course of business or consumable during use;

3.automobiles, vehicles and aircraft, timber, minerals, mineral rights and
royalties; and

4.accounts receivable, contracts, leases and operating agreements.

  

The mortgage contains provisions that impose the lien of the mortgage on
property we acquire after the date of the mortgage, other than excepted
property, subject to pre-existing liens. However, if we consolidate or merge
with, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our mortgaged property
to, another entity, unless the successor entity elects otherwise in its sole
discretion, the lien created by the mortgage will generally not cover the
property of the successor company, other than the mortgaged property it
acquires from us and improvements, replacements and additions to such
property.

  

The mortgage also provides that the trustee has a lien on the mortgaged
property to ensure the payment of its reasonable compensation, expenses and
disbursements and for indemnity against certain liabilities. This lien takes
priority over the lien securing the first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after April 30,
2016, including the Bonds, to revise the definition of “excepted encumbrances”
to mean the following:

  

  

* * *

  

•tax liens, assessments and other governmental charges or requirements which
are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•mechanics’, workmen’s, repairmen’s, materialmen’s, warehousemen’s and
carriers’ liens, other liens incident to construction, liens or privileges of
any of our employees for salary or wages earned, but not yet payable, and
other liens, including without limitation liens for worker’s compensation
awards, arising in the ordinary course of business for charges or requirements
which are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•specified judgment liens and prepaid liens;

•easements, leases, reservations or other rights of others (including
governmental entities) in, and defects of title in, our property;

•liens securing indebtedness or other obligations relating to real property we
acquired for specified transmission, distribution or communication purposes or
for the purpose of obtaining rights-of-way;

•specified leases and leasehold, license, franchise and permit interests;

•liens resulting from laws, rules, regulations, orders or rights of
governmental authorities and specified liens required by law or governmental
regulations;

•liens to secure public or statutory obligations;

•rights of others to take minerals, timber, electric energy or capacity, gas,
water, steam or other products produced by us or by others on our property;

•rights and interests of persons other than us arising out of agreements
relating to the common ownership or joint use of property, and liens on the
interests of those persons in the property;

•restrictions on assignment and/or requirements of any assignee to qualify as
a permitted assignee and/or public utility or public services corporation; and

•liens which have been bonded for the full amount in dispute or for the
payment of which other adequate security arrangements have been made.

  

Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds

  

Subject to the issuance restrictions described below, the aggregate principal
amount of first mortgage bonds that we can issue under the mortgage is
unlimited. First mortgage bonds of any series may be issued from time to time
on the basis of:

  

1.70% of property additions after adjustments to offset retirements;

2.retirements of first mortgage bonds; or

3.deposit of cash with the trustee.

  

Property additions generally include, among other things, electric, gas, steam
or hot water property acquired after December 31, 1987. Securities,
automobiles, vehicles or aircraft, or property used principally for the
production or gathering of natural gas, are not included as property
additions. Deposited cash may be withdrawn upon the bases stated in clause (1)
or (2) above.

  

The mortgage contains restrictions on the issuance of first mortgage bonds
against property subject to liens.

  

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,795 million principal amount
of first mortgage bonds outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, we could have
issued approximately $964 million principal amount of additional first
mortgage bonds on the basis of retired first mortgage bonds, and we

  

* * *

  

had approximately $856 million of unfunded property additions, entitling us to
issue approximately $599 million principal amount of additional first mortgage
bonds on the basis of property additions. The Bonds were issued on the basis
of property additions.

  

Other than the security afforded by the lien of the mortgage and restrictions
on the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds described above, there are
no provisions of the mortgage that grant the holders of the first mortgage
bonds protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction involving us.

  

Release and Substitution of Property

  

Property may be released from the lien of the mortgage on the basis of:

  

1\. the deposit with the trustee of cash or purchase money mortgages;

2\. the lower of cost or fair value to us of unfunded property additions
designated by us, after adjustments in certain cases to offset retirements and
after making adjustments for certain prior lien bonds, if any, outstanding
against property additions; or

3\. an amount equal to the principal amount of the retired first mortgage
bonds that we elect to use as the basis for such release times the reciprocal
of the bonding ratio in effect at the time such retired first mortgage bonds
were originally issued.

  

Property owned by us on December 31, 1987, may be released from the lien of
the mortgage at its depreciated book value on December 31, 1987; all other
property may be released at its cost, as defined in the mortgage. Unfunded
property may also be released without complying with clauses (1), (2) or (3)
above if, after its release, we would have at least one dollar of unfunded
property that remains subject to the lien of the mortgage.

  

We can withdraw cash upon the bases stated in clauses (2) and/or (3) above.

  

Generally, “Funded Property” under the mortgage means all mortgaged property
owned by us on December 31, 1987, and all property additions used as the basis
for the issuance of first mortgage bonds, the release of mortgaged property or
the withdrawal of cash held by the trustee. We may at any time, without
further consent of any holders of first mortgage bonds, change the definition
of “Funded Property” to mean any mortgaged property specified by us with a
fair value, to be determined by an independent expert, of not less than
10/7ths of the sum of the amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds and
retired bond credits, together with all property additions thereafter used as
the basis for the issuance of first mortgage bonds, the release of mortgaged
property or the withdrawal of cash held by the trustee.

  

We may, without any release or consent by the trustee, cancel or make changes
or alterations in or substitutions for any and all easements, servitudes,
rights-of-way and similar rights and/or interests.

  

Modification

  

Modification Without Consent

  

Without the consent of any holder of first mortgage bonds, we and the trustee
may enter into one or more supplemental indentures for any of the following
purposes:

  

•to evidence the assumption by any permitted successor of our covenants in the
mortgage and in the first mortgage bonds;

•to add one or more covenants or other provisions for the benefit of the
holders of all or any series or tranche of first mortgage bonds, or to
surrender any right or power conferred upon us;

  

* * *

  

•to cure any ambiguity in the mortgage or any supplemental indenture; or

•to establish the form or terms of first mortgage bonds of any other series as
permitted by the mortgage;

  

provided that any such modification does not adversely affect any first
mortgage bonds then outstanding.

  

We have the right to amend the mortgage at any time without any consent or
other action of the holders of any first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds,
for any of the following additional purposes:

  

•to add additional events of default under the mortgage for all or any series
of first mortgage bonds;

•to correct or amplify the description of the mortgaged property or to subject
additional property to the lien of the mortgage;

•to change, eliminate or add any provision to the mortgage; provided that no
such change, elimination or addition will adversely affect the interests of
the holders of first mortgage bonds of any series in any material respect;

•to provide for the procedures required for use of a non-certificated system
of registration for the first mortgage bonds of all or any series;

•to change any place where principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be
payable, first mortgage bonds may be surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange, and notices and demands to us may be served; and

•to cure any ambiguity or inconsistency or to make any other changes or
additions to the provisions of the mortgage if such changes or additions will
not adversely affect the interests of first mortgage bonds of any series in
any material respect.

  

Modification Requiring Consent

  

Except as provided below, the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of then outstanding first mortgage bonds,
considered as one class, is required for all other amendments or modifications
to the mortgage. However, if less than all of the series of first mortgage
bonds outstanding are directly affected by a proposed amendment or
modification, then the consent of the holders of only a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds of all series that
are directly affected, considered as one class, will be required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made
without the consent of the holder of each directly affected first mortgage
bond then outstanding to:

  

•impair or affect the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal
of (and premium, if any) and interest on such first mortgage bond, on or after
the respective due dates expressed in such first mortgage bond, or to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates;

•permit the creation of any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien
of the mortgage with respect to the mortgaged property, or permit the
deprivation of any non-assenting holder of a first mortgage bond of a lien on
the mortgaged property for the security of such holder’s first mortgage bonds
(subject only to certain tax, assessment and governmental liens and certain
prior liens); or

•permit the reduction of the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding
first mortgage bonds of any series the consent of the holders of which is
required for any amendment or modification.

  

The mortgage provides that first mortgage bonds owned by us, for our benefit
or by any affiliate of ours shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of
certain votes, consents or quorums; provided that first mortgage bonds that
have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee
establishes to the satisfaction of the trustee its right to vote such first
mortgage bonds and such pledgee is not our affiliate.

  

* * *

  

  

Any request, consent or vote of the owner of any first mortgage bond will bind
every future holder and owner of that first mortgage bond and the holder and
owner of every first mortgage bond issued upon the registration of transfer of
or in exchange for that first mortgage bond.

  

Defaults and Notices Thereof

  

Defaults under the mortgage include:

  

1.failure to pay the principal of any first mortgage bond after it is due and
payable;

2.failure to pay interest upon any first mortgage bond for a period of 30 days
after it is due and payable;

3.certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization;

4.defaults under a supplemental indenture; and

5.the expiration of a period of 90 days after the mailing by the trustee to us
of a written demand, or by the holders of 15% in principal amount of the first
mortgage bonds at the time outstanding to the trustee and us of a written
demand, that we perform a specified covenant or agreement in the mortgage or a
first mortgage bond, which specified covenant or agreement we shall have
failed to perform prior to such mailing, unless during such period we shall
have performed such covenant or agreement or shall have in good faith
commenced efforts to perform the same. The trustee may, and, if requested to
do so in writing by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the first
mortgage bonds outstanding, shall, make such demand.

  

The trustee may withhold notice of default, except in payment of principal,
interest or funds for purchase or redemption of first mortgage bonds, if the
trustee in good faith determines it is in the interests of the holders of
first mortgage bonds.

  

Remedies

  

Acceleration of Maturity

  

If a default under the mortgage occurs and is continuing, then the trustee, by
written notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds, by written notice to the
trustee and us, may declare the principal amount of all of the first mortgage
bonds to be due and payable immediately, and upon the giving of such notice,
such principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest will become immediately
due and payable.

  

There is no automatic acceleration, even in the event of our bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization.

  

Annulment of Acceleration

  

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made but before
any sale of the mortgaged property, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds may annul such declaration of
acceleration, by written notice to the trustee and us, if the default under
the mortgage giving rise to such declaration of acceleration has been cured,
and we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

  

(1) all overdue interest on all outstanding first mortgage bonds;

  

* * *

  

(2) the principal of and premium, if any, on the outstanding first mortgage
bonds that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration
and overdue interest thereon;

(3) interest on overdue interest, if any, to the extent lawful, at the rate
borne by the first mortgage bonds for which interest is overdue plus 1% per
year; and

(4) all amounts due to the trustee under the mortgage.

  

Trustee Powers

  

Subject to the mortgage, under specified circumstances and to the extent
permitted by law, if a default under the mortgage occurs, the trustee shall be
entitled to the appointment of a receiver for the mortgaged property and is
entitled to all other remedies available under applicable law.

  

Control by Holders

  

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the first mortgage bonds may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any remedy
available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
trustee. The trustee is not obligated to comply with directions that conflict
with law or other provisions of the mortgage or that the trustee determines in
good faith would involve the trustee in personal liability, would be
unjustifiably prejudicial to non-assenting holders or would be in
circumstances where indemnity would not be sufficient. The trustee is not
required to risk its funds or incur personal liability if there is reasonable
ground for believing that repayment is not reasonably assured.

  

Limitation on Holders’ Right to Institute Proceedings

  

No holder of first mortgage bonds will have any right to institute any
proceeding under the mortgage, or any remedy under the mortgage, unless:

  

•the holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a default
under the mortgage;

•the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding first
mortgage bonds of all series have made a written request to the trustee and
have offered the trustee reasonable opportunity and indemnity satisfactory to
the trustee to institute proceedings; and

•the trustee has failed to institute any proceeding for 60 days after notice;

  

provided that no holder or holders of first mortgage bonds shall have any
right in any manner to affect or prejudice the lien of the mortgage or to
obtain priority over other holders of outstanding first mortgage bonds.
However, these limitations do not apply to the absolute and unconditional
right of a holder of a first mortgage bond to institute suit for payment of
the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the first mortgage bond on or
after the applicable due date.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage, without any consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after October 31,
2017, to revise the limitations described in the first sentence of the
immediately preceding paragraph to apply to any proceeding or remedy under or
with respect to the mortgage or the first mortgage bonds.

  

Evidence to be Furnished to the Trustee

  

Compliance with the mortgage provisions is evidenced by written statements of
our officers or persons we select or pay. In certain cases, opinions of
counsel and certifications of an engineer, accountant, appraiser or other
expert (who in some cases must be independent) must be furnished. We

  

* * *

  

must give the trustee an annual certificate as to whether or not we have
fulfilled our obligations under the mortgage throughout the preceding year.

  

Satisfaction and Discharge of Mortgage

  

After we provide for the payment of all of the first mortgage bonds (including
the Bonds) and after paying all other sums due under the mortgage, the
mortgage may be satisfied and discharged. The first mortgage bonds will be
deemed to have been paid when money or Eligible Obligations (as defined below)
sufficient to pay the first mortgage bonds (in the opinion of an independent
accountant in the case of Eligible Obligations) at maturity or upon redemption
have been irrevocably set apart or deposited with the trustee; provided that
the trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
setting apart or deposit does not require registration under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, does not violate any applicable laws and does not result
in a taxable event with respect to the holders of the first mortgage bonds
prior to the time of their right to receive payment. “Eligible Obligations”
means obligations of the United States of America that do not permit the
redemption thereof at the issuer’s option.

  

Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance of Assets

  

The mortgage provides that we may consolidate with or merge into any other
entity or convey, transfer or lease as, or substantially as, an entirety to
any entity the mortgaged property, if:

  

•(a) the surviving or successor entity to such merger or consolidation has
authority to carry on the energy, fuel, water or steam business, or (b) the
successor entity that acquires by conveyance or transfer or that leases our
mortgaged property as, or substantially as, an entirety, is authorized to
acquire, lease or operate the mortgaged property so conveyed or transferred;

•such merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease is upon such terms
as to preserve, and in no respect impair, the lien and security of the
mortgage and the rights and powers of the trustee and the holders of first
mortgage bonds;

•the survivor or successor entity expressly assumes by supplemental indenture
our obligations on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and under the
mortgage;

•immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default under the
mortgage shall have occurred and be continuing; and

•in the case of a lease, such lease is made expressly subject to termination
by us or by the trustee and by the purchaser of the property so leased at any
sale thereof at any time during the continuance of a default under the
mortgage.

  

In the case of the conveyance or other transfer of the mortgaged property as,
or substantially as, an entirety to another entity, upon the satisfaction of
all the conditions described above, the successor entity would be substituted
for us under the mortgage, but we would not be released and discharged from
our obligations on the first mortgage bonds then outstanding.

  

If we transfer as an entirety all or substantially all of our mortgaged
property to a successor, the successor will assume all of our obligations
under the mortgage and we may be released from all such obligations.

  

The mortgage does not prevent or restrict any conveyance or other transfer or
lease of any part of the mortgaged property that does not constitute the
entirety, or substantially the entirety, of the mortgaged property.

  

Although the successor entity may, in its sole discretion, subject to the lien
of the mortgage property then owned or thereafter acquired by the successor
entity, the lien of the mortgage generally will

  

* * *

  

not cover the property of the successor entity other than the mortgaged
property it acquires from us and improvements, extensions and additions to
such property and renewals, replacements and substitutions thereof, within the
meaning of the mortgage.

  

The terms of the mortgage do not restrict mergers in which we are the
surviving entity.

  

The mortgage provides:

  

(1) that a statutory merger pursuant to which our assets and liabilities are
allocated to one or more entities shall not be considered to be a merger
subject to the provisions of the mortgage relating to a merger, consolidation
or conveyance of all or substantially all of the mortgaged property unless all
of our assets and liabilities are allocated to an entity other than us and we
do not survive such statutory merger; in all other cases of a statutory merger
pursuant to which any mortgaged property is allocated to one or more entities
other than us, each allocation of any mortgaged property to an entity other
than us shall be deemed, for purposes of the mortgage, to be a transfer of
such mortgaged property to such entity and not a merger;

(2) that any conveyance, transfer or lease of any of our properties where we
retain mortgaged property with a fair value in excess of 143% of the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds, and any other
outstanding debt secured by a purchase money lien that ranks equally with, or
senior to, the first mortgage bonds with respect to the mortgaged property,
shall not be deemed to be a conveyance, transfer or lease of all or
substantially all of our mortgaged property. This fair value will be
determined within 90 days of the conveyance, transfer or lease by an
independent expert selected by us; and

(3) that, in the case of a consolidation or merger after the consummation of
which we would be the surviving or resulting entity, unless we otherwise
provide in a supplemental indenture to the mortgage, the lien of the mortgage
will generally not cover any of the properties acquired by us in or as a
result of such transaction or any improvements, extensions or additions to
those properties.

  

Release of Obligations under the Bonds upon Transfer of All or Substantially
All Mortgaged Property

  

If we transfer as an entirety all or substantially all of our mortgaged
property to a successor, the successor will assume all of our obligations
under the Bonds and we may be released of all such obligations.

  

Consent to Amendments

  

Each holder or future holder of the Bonds, by its acquisition of an interest
in such Bonds, irrevocably (a) consented or will consent to the amendments to
the mortgage described herein under “– Security,” “– Modification –
Modification Without Consent,” and “– Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance of
Assets,” without any other or further action by any holder of such Bonds, and
(b) designated or will designate the trustee, and its successors, as its proxy
with irrevocable instructions to vote and deliver written consents on behalf
of such holder in favor of such amendments at any meeting of bondholders, in
lieu of any meeting of bondholders, in response to any consent solicitation or
otherwise.

  

Information about the Trustee

  

The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon. In addition to acting as trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon also acts, and may act, as trustee under various
other of our and our affiliates’ indentures, trusts and guarantees. We and our
affiliates maintain deposit accounts and credit and liquidity facilities and
conduct other banking transactions with the trustee and its affiliates in the
ordinary course of our respective businesses.

  

* * *

  

So long as no event of default or event that, after notice or lapse of time,
or both, would become an event of default has occurred and is continuing and
except with respect to a trustee appointed by act of the holders, if we have
delivered to the trustee a board resolution appointing a successor trustee and
the successor has accepted the appointment in accordance with the terms of the
mortgage, the trustee will be deemed to have resigned and the successor will
be deemed to have been appointed as trustee in accordance with the mortgage.

  

Book-Entry Only Securities

  

The Bonds trade through DTC. The Bonds are represented by a global certificate
and registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee. The global
certificate was deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC. Ownership of
beneficial interests in the global certificate is limited to institutions that
have accounts with DTC or its participants or persons that may hold interests
through participants.

  

DTC is a New York clearing corporation and a clearing agency registered under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for its participants.
DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement of securities transactions
among its participants through electronic computerized book-entry transfers
and pledges in the participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. The participants include
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by
the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Others who maintain a custodial
relationship with a participant can use the DTC system. The rules that apply
to DTC and those using its systems are on file with the SEC.

  

Purchases of the Bonds within the DTC system must be made through
participants, who will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The
beneficial ownership interest of each purchaser will be recorded on the
appropriate participant’s records. Beneficial owners do not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but beneficial owners should receive
written confirmations of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of
their holdings, from the participants through whom they purchased Bonds.
Transfers of ownership in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on
the books of the participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners.
Beneficial owners will not receive certificates for their Bonds, except if use
of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

  

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by participants with
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the
Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. effects no
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial
owners of the Bonds. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the
participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited. These participants may
or may not be the beneficial owners. Participants are responsible for keeping
account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, and by
participants to beneficial owners, are governed by arrangements among them,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time. Beneficial owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to
augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to
the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults and proposed amendments to
the mortgage. Beneficial owners of the Bonds may wish to ascertain that the
nominee holding the Bonds has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to the
beneficial owners.

  

  

* * *

  

Redemption notices will be sent to Cede & Co., as registered holder of the
Bonds. If less than all of the Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to
determine by lot the amount of Bonds held by each participant to be redeemed.

  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote with respect to Bonds,
unless authorized by a participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under
its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as
possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or
voting rights of Cede & Co. to those participants to whose accounts the Bonds
are credited on the record date. We believe that these arrangements will
enable the beneficial owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the
rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the Bonds.

  

Payments of redemption proceeds, principal of, and interest on the Bonds are
and will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by
DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of
funds and corresponding detail information from us or our agent, on the
payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s
records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners are and will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Payments are the
responsibility of participants and not of DTC, the trustee, or us, subject to
any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to
time. Payment of redemption proceeds, principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or
such other nominee as may be requested by DTC) is our responsibility.
Disbursement of payments to participants is the responsibility of DTC, and
disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of
participants.

  

Other than in the circumstances described herein, a beneficial owner will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Bonds. Accordingly, each
beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights
under the Bonds.

  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with
respect to the Bonds at any time by giving us reasonable notice. In the event
no successor securities depositary is obtained, certificates for the Bonds
will be printed and delivered. We may decide to replace DTC or any successor
depositary. Additionally, subject to the procedures of DTC, we may decide to
discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a
successor depositary) with respect to some or all of the Bonds. In that event
or if an event of default with respect to the Bonds has occurred and is
continuing, certificates for the Bonds will be printed and delivered. If
certificates for the Bonds are printed and delivered,

  

•those Bonds will be issued in fully registered form without coupons;

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to exchange those Bonds, without
charge, for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds, having the same
issue date and with identical terms and provisions; and

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to transfer those Bonds without
cost to another holder, other than for applicable stamp taxes or other
governmental charges.

  

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has
been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

Exhibit 4(f)4

  

DESCRIPTION OF ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, LLC’S SECURITIES

  

REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12

  

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

  

References in this exhibit to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Entergy New Orleans,
LLC.

  

We have issued, and may from time to time issue, bonds in one or more series
under one or more separate supplemental indentures to the Mortgage and Deed of
Trust dated as of May 1, 1987 with The Bank of New York Mellon, successor
trustee (the “trustee”). This Mortgage and Deed of Trust, as it has heretofore
been and may be amended or supplemented from time to time, is referred to in
this exhibit as the “mortgage.” All first mortgage bonds issued or to be
issued under the mortgage, including the Bonds (as defined below), are
referred to herein as “first mortgage bonds.”

  

As of February 26, 2021, we have two series of first mortgage bonds
outstanding that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”):

  

•our First Mortgage Bonds, 5.0% Series due December 1, 2052, issued in an
aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000 under the Sixteenth Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2012, to the mortgage and traded on the New
York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker ENJ (the “2052 Bonds”); and

•our First Mortgage Bonds, 5.50% Series due April 1, 2066, issued in an
aggregate principal amount of $110,000,000 under the Nineteenth Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of March 15, 2016, to the mortgage and traded on the NYSE
under the ticker EAE (the “2066 Bonds,” and together with the 2052 Bonds, the
“Bonds”).

  

The full aggregate principal amount of each series of the Bonds is currently
outstanding.

  

The mortgage, including the applicable supplemental indentures relating to the
Bonds, contains the full legal texts of the matters described herein. Because
this is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the mortgage, the
supplemental indentures relating to each series of Bonds, or the outstanding
first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds. The mortgage and the supplemental
indentures that relate to the outstanding first mortgage bonds, including the
Bonds, are filed as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this
is filed as an exhibit. You should read the mortgage for provisions that may
be important to you. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety
by reference to all the provisions of the mortgage, including the definitions
of some of the terms used in the mortgage, and to the particular terms of the
supplemental indenture that relates to each series of Bonds. The mortgage has
been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and you should also
refer to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 for provisions that apply to the
Bonds.

  

General

  

The mortgage permits us to issue first mortgage bonds from time to time
subject to limitations described under “Issuance of Additional First Mortgage
Bonds.” All first mortgage bonds of any one series need not be issued at the
same time, and a series may be reopened for issuances of additional first
mortgage bonds of that series. This means that we may from time to time,
without the consent of the

  

* * *

  

existing holders of the first mortgage bonds of any series, including the
Bonds, create and issue additional first mortgage bonds of a series having the
same terms and conditions as the previously issued first mortgage bonds of
that series in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and, if
applicable, the initial interest payment on those additional first mortgage
bonds. Additional first mortgage bonds issued in this manner will be
consolidated with and will form a single series with the previously issued
first mortgage bonds of that series. For more information, see the discussion
below under “Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds.”

  

Payment

  

The principal amount of the Bonds and interest thereon is and will be paid in
any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of
payment is legal tender at the corporate trust office of the trustee in the
Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York.

  

Interest on the 2052 Bonds accrues at the rate of 5.0% per year. Interest on
the 2066 Bonds accrues at the rate of 5.50% per year. In each case, interest
started to accrue from the date that the respective series of Bonds was
issued. Interest payments on the 2052 Bonds are made on March 1, June 1,
September 1 and December 1 of each year, and on the 2066 Bonds are made on
January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. As long as the Bonds
are registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its
nominee, the record date for interest payable on any interest payment date
shall be the close of business on the Business Day (defined as any day other
than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in The City
of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain
closed or a day on which the corporate trust office of the trustee is closed
for business) immediately preceding such interest payment date. We have agreed
to pay interest on any overdue principal and, if such payment is enforceable
under applicable law, on any overdue installment of interest, in the case of
the 2052 Bonds at a rate of 6.0% per year, and in the case of the 2066 Bonds
at a rate of 6.50% per year, to the holders of record at the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding our payment of such interest.

  

Interest on the Bonds is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months. If any interest payment date or the maturity date of a Bond
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on that interest
payment date or the maturity date will be made on the next Business Day, and
without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay.

  

As long as the Bonds are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, we will
pay principal and interest due on the Bonds to DTC. DTC will then make payment
to its participants for disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Bonds as
described under the heading “Book-Entry Only Securities.”

  

Redemption and Purchase

  

Optional Redemption

  

We may redeem the Bonds prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at our option,
on not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice to holders by mail,
(i) in the case of the 2052 Bonds, at any time, and (ii) in the case of the
2066 Bonds, at any time on or after April 1, 2021; in each case, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds being
redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including,
the redemption date.

  

Unless the Bonds are held in book-entry only form through the facilities of
DTC, in which case DTC’s procedures for selection shall apply (see “Book-Entry
Only Securities”), if less than all of the Bonds of any securities are to be
redeemed, the trustee will select the Bonds to be redeemed.

  

  

* * *

  

Unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest,
if any, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Bonds
subject to such notice of redemption will cease to bear interest on the
redemption date. We will pay the redemption price and any accrued interest to
the redemption date upon presentation and surrender of any Bond for
redemption. If only part of a Bond is redeemed, the trustee will deliver to
the holder of the Bond a new Bond of the same series for the remaining portion
without charge.

We may make any redemption at our option conditional upon the receipt by the
trustee, prior to the date fixed for redemption, of money sufficient to pay
the redemption price and accrued interest, if any. If the trustee has not
received the money by the date fixed for redemption, we will not be required
to redeem the Bonds.

  

Redemption of Bonds at Option of Holders

  

The terms of the franchise ordinances pursuant to which we provide electric
and gas service to the City of New Orleans state that the City has a
continuing option to purchase our electric and gas properties. If all or
substantially all of our property subject to the mortgage is taken or acquired
by the City of New Orleans or any instrumentality or designee thereof, upon
the consummation of this taking or acquisition, we have agreed to direct the
trustee to send a written notice to each registered holder of bonds then
outstanding stating that each such holder has the right to require us to
redeem its bonds, in whole or in part, at the special redemption price of 101%
of the principal amount of the bonds being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.

  

Upon the mailing of notice by the trustee, each holder will have 45 days to
deliver written notice to the trustee of such holder’s intent to have its
bonds redeemed by us in accordance with the preceding paragraph on the 60th
day following the date of the notice upon delivery and surrender of such bond.

  

Exchange or Redemption of Bonds upon Merger or Consolidation

  

Although we do not currently have any plans to merge or consolidate with
Entergy Louisiana, LLC, one of our affiliates, the mortgage provides that, in
the event of such a merger or consolidation, we would have the right to offer
to exchange all outstanding Bonds for a like principal amount of the new
merged or consolidated company’s first mortgage bonds with the same interest
rates, interest payment dates, maturity dates and redemption provisions.
Unless we waive this right, the holders of outstanding Bonds must either
accept such first mortgage bonds in exchange for all or a portion of their
Bonds or tender to us for redemption any Bonds not so exchanged. The
redemption price applicable for these purposes to the Bonds will be 100% of
the principal amount plus accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the
redemption date.

  

Form and Exchange

  

The Bonds are fully-registered bonds without coupons, issued in denominations
of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. Each series of the
Bonds is represented by a global certificate without coupons registered in the
name of a nominee of DTC.

  

The Bonds are exchangeable for other Bonds of the same series in equal
aggregate principal amounts. No service charge will be made for any
registration of transfer or exchange of the Bonds. However, we may require
payment to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with a registration of transfer or exchange. We will not be
required to provide for the transfer or exchange of any Bond:

  

  

* * *

  

•during the 15 days before an interest payment date (unless such series has a
record date for the payment of interest),

•during the 15 days before any designation of such Bond to be redeemed, or

•selected for redemption.

  

Security

  

The Bonds, together with all other first mortgage bonds now or in the future
outstanding under the mortgage, are and will be secured, equally and ratably,
by the lien of the mortgage. The mortgage constitutes a first mortgage lien on
substantially all of our property (the “mortgaged property”) subject to
bankruptcy law and:

  

1.minor defects and encumbrances customarily found in similar properties that
do not materially impair the use of the mortgaged property in the conduct of
our business;

2.other liens, defects and encumbrances, if any, existing or created at the
time of our acquisition of the mortgaged property; and

3.excepted encumbrances.

  

The mortgage does not create a lien on the following “excepted property”:

  

•cash and securities;

•all merchandise, equipment, apparatus, materials or supplies held for sale or
other disposition in the usual course of business or consumable during use;

•automobiles, vehicles and aircraft, timber, minerals, mineral rights and
royalties; and

•accounts receivable, contracts, leases and operating agreements.

  

The mortgage contains provisions that impose the lien of the mortgage on
property we acquire after the date of the mortgage, other than excepted
property, subject to pre-existing liens. However, if we consolidate or merge
with, or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our mortgaged property
to, another entity, unless the successor entity elects otherwise in its sole
discretion, the lien created by the mortgage will generally not cover the
property of the successor company, other than the mortgaged property it
acquires from us and improvements, replacements and additions to such
property.

  

The mortgage also provides that the trustee has a lien on the mortgaged
property to ensure the payment of its reasonable compensation, expenses and
disbursements and for indemnity against certain liabilities. This lien takes
priority over the lien securing the first mortgage bonds, including the Bonds.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after November 30,
2017, to revise the definition of “excepted encumbrances” to mean the
following:

  

•tax liens, assessments and other governmental charges or requirements which
are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of which at least ten business days’ notice has not
been given to our general counsel or to such other person designated by us to
receive such notices;

•mechanics’, workmen’s, repairmen’s, materialmen’s, warehousemen’s and
carriers’ liens, other liens incident to construction, liens or privileges of
any of our employees for salary or wages earned, but not yet payable, and
other liens, including without limitation liens for worker’s compensation
awards, arising in the ordinary course of business for charges or requirements
which are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings or of

  

* * *

  

which at least ten business days’ notice has not been given to our general
counsel or to such other person designated by us to receive such notices;

•specified judgment liens and prepaid liens;

•easements, leases, reservations or other rights of others (including
governmental entities) in, and defects of title in, our property;

•liens securing indebtedness or other obligations relating to real property we
acquired for specified transmission, distribution or communication purposes or
for the purpose of obtaining rights-of-way;

•specified leases and leasehold, license, franchise and permit interests;

•liens resulting from laws, rules, regulations, orders or rights of
governmental authorities and specified liens required by law or governmental
regulations;

•liens to secure public or statutory obligations;

•rights of others to take minerals, timber, electric energy or capacity, gas,
water, steam or other products produced by us or by others on our property;

•rights and interests of persons other than us arising out of agreements
relating to the common ownership or joint use of property, and liens on the
interests of those persons in the property;

•restrictions on assignment and/or requirements of any assignee to qualify as
a permitted assignee and/or public utility or public services corporation; and

•liens which have been bonded for the full amount in dispute or for the
payment of which other adequate security arrangements have been made.

  

Issuance of Additional First Mortgage Bonds

  

The maximum principal amount of first mortgage bonds that may be issued under
the mortgage is limited to $10 billion at any time outstanding under the
mortgage, subject to the issuance restrictions described below. First mortgage
bonds of any series may be issued from time to time on the basis of:

  

1.70% of property additions after adjustments to offset retirements;

2.retirements of first mortgage bonds; or

3.deposit of cash with the trustee.

  

Property additions generally include, among other things, electric, gas, steam
or hot water property acquired after December 31, 1986. Securities,
automobiles, vehicles or aircraft, or property used principally for the
production or gathering of natural gas, are not included as property
additions. Deposited cash may be withdrawn upon the bases stated in clause (1)
or (2) above.

  

The mortgage contains restrictions on the issuance of first mortgage bonds
against property subject to liens.

  

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $550 million principal amount of
first mortgage bonds outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, we could have
issued approximately $165 million principal amount of additional first
mortgage bonds on the basis of retired first mortgage bonds, and we had
approximately $324 million of unfunded property additions, entitling us to
issue approximately $227 million principal amount of additional first mortgage
bonds on the basis of property additions. The 2052 Bonds were issued on the
basis of retired bond credits, and the 2066 Bonds were issued on the basis of
property additions.

  

Other than the security afforded by the lien of the mortgage and restrictions
on the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds described above, there are
no provisions of the mortgage that grant the holders of the first mortgage
bonds protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction involving us.

  

  

* * *

  

Release and Substitution of Property

  

Property other than the Municipalization Interest (as defined in the mortgage)
may be released from the lien of the mortgage, on the basis of:

  

1.the deposit with the trustee of cash or purchase money mortgages;

2.the lower of cost or fair value to us of unfunded property additions
designated by us, after adjustments in certain cases to offset retirements and
after making adjustments for certain prior lien bonds, if any, outstanding
against property additions; or

3.an amount equal to the principal amount of the retired first mortgage bonds
that we elect to use as the basis for such release times the reciprocal of the
bonding ratio in effect at the time such retired first mortgage bonds were
originally issued.

  

Property owned by us on December 31, 1986 may be released from the lien of the
mortgage at its depreciated book value on December 31, 1986; all other
property may be released at its cost, as defined in the mortgage. Unfunded
property may also be released without complying with clauses (1), (2) or (3)
above if, after its release, we would have at least one dollar in unfunded
property that remains subject to the lien of the mortgage.

  

We can withdraw cash upon the bases stated in clauses (2) or (3) above.

  

Generally, “funded property” under the mortgage means all mortgaged property
owned by us on December 31, 1986 and all property additions used as the basis
for the issuance of first mortgage bonds, the release of mortgaged property or
the withdrawal of cash held by the trustee. We may at any time, without the
further consent of any holders of first mortgage bonds, change the definition
of “funded property” to mean any mortgaged property specified by us with a
fair value, to be determined by an independent expert, of not less than
10/7ths of the sum of the amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds and
retired bond credits, together with all property additions thereafter used as
the basis for the issuance of first mortgage bonds, the release of mortgaged
property or the withdrawal of cash held by the trustee.

  

We may, without any release or consent by the trustee, cancel or make changes
or alterations in or substitutions for any and all easements, servitudes,
rights of way and similar rights and/or interests.

  

Modification

  

Modification Without Consent

  

Without the consent of any holder of first mortgage bonds, we and the trustee
may enter into one or more supplemental indentures for any of the following
purposes:

  

•to evidence the assumption by any permitted successor of our covenants in the
mortgage and in the first mortgage bonds;

•to add one or more covenants or other provisions for the benefit of the
holders of all or any series or tranche of first mortgage bonds, or to
surrender any right or power conferred upon us;

•to cure any ambiguity in the mortgage or any supplemental indenture; or

•to establish the form or terms of first mortgage bonds of any other series as
permitted by the mortgage;

  

provided that any such modification does not adversely affect any first
mortgage bonds then outstanding.

  

  

* * *

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or action
of any of the holders of first mortgage bonds created after October 31, 2012,
including the Bonds, to permit us to amend the mortgage without the consent of
the holders of first mortgage bonds for any of the following additional
purposes:

  

•to add additional events of default under the mortgage for all or any series
of first mortgage bonds;

•to correct or amplify the description of the mortgaged property or to subject
additional property to the lien of the mortgage;

•to change, eliminate or add any provision to the mortgage; provided that no
such change, elimination or addition will adversely affect the interests of
the holders of first mortgage bonds of any series in any material respect;

•to provide for the procedures required for use of a non-certificated system
of registration for the first mortgage bonds of all or any series;

•to change any place where principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be
payable, first mortgage bonds may be surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange, and notices and demands to us may be served; and

•to cure any ambiguity or inconsistency or to make any other changes or
additions to the provisions of the mortgage if such changes or additions will
not adversely affect the interests of first mortgage bonds of any series in
any material respect.

  

Modification Requiring Consent

  

Except as provided below, the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of then outstanding first mortgage bonds,
considered as one class, is required for all other amendments or modifications
to the mortgage. However, if less than all of the series of first mortgage
bonds outstanding are directly affected by a proposed amendment or
modification, then the consent of the holders of only a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds of all series that
are directly affected, considered as one class, will be required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made
without the consent of the holder of each directly affected first mortgage
bond then outstanding to:

  

•impair or affect the right of such holder to receive payment of the principal
of (and premium, if any) and interest on such first mortgage bond, on or after
the respective due dates expressed in such first mortgage bond, or to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates;

•permit the creation of any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien
of the mortgage with respect to the mortgaged property, or permit the
deprivation of any non-assenting holder of a first mortgage bond of a lien on
the mortgaged property for the security of such holder’s first mortgage bonds
(subject only to certain tax, assessment and governmental liens and certain
prior liens); or

•permit the reduction of the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding
first mortgage bonds of any series the consent of the holders of which is
required for any amendment or modification.

  

The mortgage provides that first mortgage bonds owned by us, for our benefit
or by any affiliate of ours shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of
certain votes, consents or quorums; provided that first mortgage bonds that
have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee
establishes to the satisfaction of the trustee its right to vote such first
mortgage bonds and such pledgee is not our affiliate.

  

Any request, consent or vote of the owner of any first mortgage bond will bind
every future holder and owner of that first mortgage bond and the holder and
owner of every first mortgage bond issued upon the registration of transfer of
or in exchange for that first mortgage bond.

  

* * *

  

  

Defaults and Notices Thereof

  

Defaults under the mortgage include:

  

1.failure to pay the principal of any first mortgage bond after it is due and
payable;

2.failure to pay interest upon any first mortgage bond for a period of 30 days
after it is due and payable;

3.certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization;

4.defaults under a supplemental indenture; and

5.the expiration of a period of 90 days after the mailing by the trustee to us
of a written demand, or by the holders of 15% in principal amount of the first
mortgage bonds at the time outstanding to the trustee and us of a written
demand, that we perform a specified covenant or agreement in the mortgage or a
first mortgage bond, which specified covenant or agreement we shall have
failed to perform prior to such mailing, unless during such period we shall
have performed such covenant or agreement or shall have in good faith
commenced efforts to perform the same. The trustee may, and, if requested to
do so in writing by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the first
mortgage bonds outstanding, shall, make such demand.

  

The trustee may withhold notice of default, except in payment of principal,
interest or funds for purchase or redemption of first mortgage bonds, if the
trustee in good faith determines it is in the interests of the holders of
first mortgage bonds.

  

Remedies

  

Acceleration of Maturity

  

If a default under the mortgage occurs and is continuing, then the trustee, by
written notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds, by written notice to the
trustee and us, may declare the principal amount of all of the first mortgage
bonds to be due and payable immediately, and upon the giving of such notice,
such principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest will become immediately
due and payable.

  

There is no automatic acceleration, even in the event of our bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization.

  

Annulment of Acceleration

  

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made but before
any sale of the mortgaged property, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds may annul such declaration of
acceleration, by written notice to the trustee and us, if the default under
the mortgage giving rise to such declaration of acceleration has been cured,
and we have paid or deposited with the trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

  

1.all overdue interest on all outstanding first mortgage bonds;

2.the principal of and premium, if any, on the outstanding first mortgage
bonds that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration
and overdue interest thereon;

3.interest on overdue interest, if any, to the extent lawful, at the rate
borne by the first mortgage bonds for which interest is overdue plus 1% per
year; and

4.all amounts due to the trustee under the mortgage.

  

  

* * *

  

Trustee Powers

  

Subject to the mortgage, under specified circumstances and to the extent
permitted by law, if a default under the mortgage occurs, the trustee shall be
entitled to the appointment of a receiver for the mortgaged property and is
entitled to all other remedies available under applicable law.

  

Control by Holders

  

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the first mortgage bonds may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceedings for any remedy
available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
trustee. The trustee is not obligated to comply with directions that conflict
with law or other provisions of the mortgage or that the trustee determines in
good faith would involve the trustee in personal liability, would be
unjustifiably prejudicial to non-assenting holders or would be in
circumstances where indemnity would not be sufficient. The trustee is not
required to risk its funds or incur personal liability if there is reasonable
ground for believing that repayment is not reasonably assured.

  

Limitation on Holders’ Right to Institute Proceedings

  

No holder of first mortgage bonds will have any right to institute any
proceeding under the mortgage, or any remedy under the mortgage, unless:

  

•the holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a default
under the mortgage;

•the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding first
mortgage bonds of all series have made a written request to the trustee and
have offered the trustee reasonable opportunity and indemnity satisfactory to
the trustee to institute proceedings; and

•the trustee has failed to institute any proceeding for 60 days after notice;

  

provided that no holder or holders of first mortgage bonds shall have any
right in any manner to affect or prejudice the lien of the mortgage or to
obtain priority over other holders of outstanding first mortgage bonds.
However, these limitations do not apply to the absolute and unconditional
right of a holder of a first mortgage bond to institute suit for payment of
the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the first mortgage bond on or
after the applicable due date.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage, without any consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after November 30,
2017, to revise the limitations described in the first sentence of the
immediately preceding paragraph to apply to any proceeding or remedy under or
with respect to the mortgage or the first mortgage bonds.

  

Evidence to be Furnished to the Trustee

  

Compliance with the mortgage provisions is evidenced by written statements of
our officers or persons we select or pay. In certain cases, opinions of
counsel and certifications of an engineer, accountant, appraiser or other
expert (who in some cases must be independent) must be furnished. We must give
the trustee an annual certificate as to whether or not we have fulfilled our
obligations under the mortgage throughout the preceding year.

  

Satisfaction and Discharge of Mortgage

  

After we provide for the payment of all of the first mortgage bonds (including
the Bonds) and after paying all other sums due under the mortgage, the
mortgage may be satisfied and discharged. The first

  

* * *

  

mortgage bonds will be deemed to have been paid when money or Eligible
Obligations (as defined below) sufficient to pay the first mortgage bonds (in
the opinion of an independent accountant in the case of Eligible Obligations)
at maturity or upon redemption have been irrevocably set apart or deposited
with the trustee; provided that the trustee shall have received an opinion of
counsel to the effect that the setting apart or deposit does not require
registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, does not violate any
applicable laws and does not result in a taxable event with respect to the
holders of the first mortgage bonds prior to the time of their right to
receive payment. “Eligible Obligations” means obligations of the United States
of America that do not permit the redemption thereof at the issuer’s option.

  

Consolidation, Merger and Conveyance of Assets

  

The mortgage provides that we may consolidate with or merge into any other
entity or convey, transfer or lease as, or substantially as, an entirety to
any entity the mortgaged property, if:

  

•(a) the surviving or successor entity to such merger or consolidation has
authority to carry on the energy, fuel, water or steam business, or (b) the
successor entity that acquires by conveyance or transfer or that leases our
mortgaged property as, or substantially as, an entirety, is authorized to
acquire, lease or operate the mortgaged property so conveyed or transferred;

•such merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease is upon such terms
as to preserve, and in no respect impair, the lien and security of the
mortgage and the rights and powers of the trustee and the holders of first
mortgage bonds;

•the survivor or successor entity expressly assumes by supplemental indenture
our obligations on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and under the
mortgage;

•immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default under the
mortgage shall have occurred and be continuing; and

•in the case of a lease, such lease is made expressly subject to termination
by us or by the trustee and by the purchaser of the property so leased at any
sale thereof at any time during the continuance of a default under the
mortgage.

  

In the case of the conveyance or other transfer of the mortgaged property as,
or substantially as, an entirety to another entity, upon the satisfaction of
all the conditions described above, the successor entity would be substituted
for us under the mortgage, but we would not be released and discharged from
our obligations on the first mortgage bonds then outstanding.

  

The mortgage does not prevent or restrict any conveyance or other transfer, or
lease, of any part of the mortgaged property that does not constitute the
entirety, or substantially the entirety, of the mortgaged property.

  

Although the successor entity may, in its sole discretion, subject to the lien
of the mortgage property then owned or thereafter acquired by the successor
entity, the lien of the mortgage generally will not cover the property of the
successor entity other than the mortgaged property it acquires from us and
improvements, extensions and additions to such property and renewals,
replacements and substitutions thereof, within the meaning of the mortgage.

  

The terms of the mortgage do not restrict mergers in which we are the
surviving entity.

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage without the consent or other
action of the holders of any of the first mortgage bonds created after October
31, 2012, including the Bonds, to provide that, if we transfer as an entirety
all or substantially all of our mortgaged property to a successor, the
successor will assume all of our obligations under the mortgage and the first
mortgage bonds and we may be released of all such obligations.

  

* * *

  

  

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage, without any consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after November 30,
2017, as follows:

  

1.to provide that a statutory merger pursuant to which our assets and
liabilities are allocated to one or more entities shall not be considered to
be a merger subject to the provisions of the mortgage relating to a merger,
consolidation or conveyance of all or substantially all of the mortgaged
property unless all of our assets and liabilities are allocated to an entity
other than us and we do not survive such statutory merger; in all other cases
of a statutory merger pursuant to which any mortgaged property is allocated to
one or more entities other than us, each allocation of any mortgaged property
to an entity other than us shall be deemed, for purposes of the mortgage, to
be a transfer of such mortgaged property to such entity and not a merger;

2.to provide that any conveyance, transfer or lease of any of our properties
where we retain mortgaged property with a fair value in excess of 143% of the
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding first mortgage bonds, and any
other outstanding debt secured by a purchase money lien that ranks equally
with, or senior to, the first mortgage bonds with respect to the mortgaged
property, shall not be deemed to be a conveyance, transfer or lease of all or
substantially all of our mortgaged property. This fair value will be
determined within 90 days of the conveyance, transfer or lease by an
independent expert selected by us; and

3.to provide that, in the case of a consolidation or merger after the
consummation of which we would be the surviving or resulting entity, unless we
otherwise provide in a supplemental indenture to the mortgage, the lien of the
mortgage will generally not cover any of the properties acquired by us in or
as a result of such transaction or any improvements, extensions or additions
to those properties.

  

Release of Obligations under the Bonds upon Transfer of All or Substantially
All Mortgaged Property

  

If we transfer as an entirety all or substantially all of our mortgaged
property to a successor, the successor will assume all of our obligations
under the Bonds and we may be released of all such obligations.

  

Consent to Amendments

  

Each holder or future holder of the 2066 Bonds, by its acquisition of an
interest in such Bonds, irrevocably (a) consented or will consent to the
amendments to the mortgage described herein under “– Modification –
Modification Without Consent” in the sixth paragraph under “Consolidation,
Merger and Conveyance of Assets,” without any other or further action by any
holder of such Bonds, and (b) designated or will designate the trustee, and
its successors, as its proxy with irrevocable instructions to vote and deliver
written consents on behalf of such holder in favor of such amendments at any
meeting of bondholders, in lieu of any meeting of bondholders, in response to
any consent solicitation or otherwise.

  

Information about the Trustee

  

The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon. In addition to acting as trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon also acts, and may act, as trustee under various
other of our and our affiliates’ indentures, trusts and guarantees. We and our
affiliates maintain deposit accounts and credit and liquidity facilities and
conduct other banking transactions with the trustee and its affiliates in the
ordinary course of our respective businesses.

We have reserved the right to amend the mortgage, without any consent or other
action by the holders of any first mortgage bonds created after November 30,
2017, to provide that, so long as no event of default or event that, after
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default has

  

* * *

  

occurred and is continuing and except with respect to a trustee appointed by
act of the holders, if we have delivered to the trustee a board resolution
appointing a successor trustee and the successor has accepted the appointment
in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, the trustee will be deemed to
have resigned and the successor will be deemed to have been appointed as
trustee in accordance with the mortgage.

  

Book-Entry Only Securities

  

The Bonds trade through DTC. Each series of Bonds is represented by a separate
global certificate and registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee.
The global certificates were deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC.
Ownership of beneficial interests in the global certificates is limited to
institutions that have accounts with DTC or its participants or persons that
may hold interests through participants.

  

DTC is a New York clearing corporation and a clearing agency registered under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for its participants.
DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement of securities transactions
among its participants through electronic computerized book‑entry transfers
and pledges in the participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. The participants include
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by
the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Others who maintain a custodial
relationship with a participant can use the DTC system. The rules that apply
to DTC and those using its systems are on file with the SEC.

  

Purchases of the Bonds within the DTC system must be made through
participants, who will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The
beneficial ownership interest of each purchaser will be recorded on the
appropriate participant’s records. Beneficial owners do not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but beneficial owners should receive
written confirmations of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of
their holdings, from the participants through whom they purchased Bonds.
Transfers of ownership in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on
the books of the participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners.
Beneficial owners will not receive certificates for their Bonds of a given
series, except if use of the book‑entry system for the Bonds of that series is
discontinued.

  

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by participants with
DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the
Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. effects no
change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial
owners of the Bonds. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the
participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited. These participants may
or may not be the beneficial owners. Participants are responsible for keeping
account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, and by
participants to beneficial owners, are governed by arrangements among them,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time. Beneficial owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to
augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to
the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults and proposed amendments to
the mortgage. Beneficial owners of the Bonds may wish to ascertain that the
nominee holding the Bonds has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to the
beneficial owners.

  

  

* * *

  

Redemption notices will be sent to Cede & Co., as registered holder of the
Bonds. If less than all of the Bonds of a series are being redeemed, DTC’s
practice is to determine by lot the amount of Bonds of such series held by
each participant to be redeemed.

  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote with respect to Bonds,
unless authorized by a participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under
its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as
possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or
voting rights of Cede & Co. to those participants to whose accounts the Bonds
are credited on the record date. We believe that these arrangements will
enable the beneficial owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the
rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the Bonds.

  

Payments of redemption proceeds, principal of, and interest on the Bonds are
and will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by
DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of
funds and corresponding detail information from us or our agent, on the
payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s
records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners are and will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Payments are the
responsibility of participants and not of DTC, the trustee, or us, subject to
any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to
time. Payment of redemption proceeds, principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or
such other nominee as may be requested by DTC) is our responsibility.
Disbursement of payments to participants is the responsibility of DTC, and
disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of
participants.

  

Other than in the circumstances described herein, a beneficial owner will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Bonds. Accordingly, each
beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights
under the Bonds.

  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with
respect to the Bonds at any time by giving us reasonable notice. In the event
no successor securities depositary is obtained, certificates for the Bonds
will be printed and delivered. We may decide to replace DTC or any successor
depositary. Additionally, subject to the procedures of DTC, we may decide to
discontinue use of the system of book‑entry transfers through DTC (or a
successor depositary) with respect to some or all of the Bonds. In that event
or if an event of default with respect to a series of Bonds has occurred and
is continuing, certificates for the Bonds of such series will be printed and
delivered. If certificates for such series of Bonds are printed and delivered,

  

•those Bonds will be issued in fully registered form without coupons;

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to exchange those Bonds, without
charge, for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the same series,
having the same issue date and with identical terms and provisions; and

•a holder of certificated Bonds would be able to transfer those Bonds without
cost to another holder, other than for applicable stamp taxes or other
governmental charges.

  

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book‑entry system has
been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

Exhibit 4(g)13

  

DESCRIPTION OF ENTERGY TEXAS, INC.’S SECURITIES

  

REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12

  

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

  

References in this exhibit to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Entergy Texas, Inc.

  

As of February 26, 2021, we have one series of preferred stock outstanding
that is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our 5.375% Series A Preferred Stock,
Cumulative, No Par Value (Liquidation Value $25 Per Share), traded on the NYSE
under the ticker ETI/PR (the “Series A Preferred Stock”).

  

The following description of the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to
be complete. Reference is made to the Texas Business Organizations Code
(“TXBOC”), our Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation, as amended by
the Statement of Resolution Establishing the Series A Preferred Stock
(“Resolution”) adopted by our Board of Directors (as so amended, the
“Charter”), and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”). Each of the
Charter and the Bylaws are filed as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K
to which this is filed as an exhibit. The following statements are qualified
in their entirety by such references.

  

General

  

Our Board of Directors is authorized under the Charter to provide for the
issuance from time to time of Preferred Stock, with no par value (“Preferred
Stock”), in one or more series, and, as to each series, to fix and determine
the designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, including
voting rights, applicable to shares of such series.

  

Under the Charter, we are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, with no par value (“Common Stock”) and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock.

  

The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to further capital calls or to
assessment by us and has no exchange or conversion rights.

  

Dividends

  

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as
and if, declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available,
cash dividends at a rate per year equal to 5.375% and are not entitled to
receive any other dividends.

  

Preferred dividends began accumulating on each share of Series A Preferred
Stock from the date of issuance of that share. The preferred dividends
accumulate from day to day, whether or not earned or declared by the Board of
Directors, and are cumulative. The preferred dividends, if and when declared
payable by the Board of Directors out of our legally available funds, will be
payable in lawful money of the United States of America, quarterly on January
15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year (each, a “Dividend Payment
Date”). To the extent that any preferred dividend is not paid on any Dividend
Payment Date, that preferred dividend will accumulate until such preferred
dividend is paid in full. The

  

* * *

  

preferred dividends payable on each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months,
and with respect to any period less than a full dividend period, on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed during such period.

  

No dividend or distribution in cash or other property (other than shares of
Junior Stock (as defined herein)) will be declared, paid, or set apart for
payment on or with respect to the Junior Stock unless all preferred dividends
on the Series A Preferred Stock accumulated through the date of any
distribution have been declared, paid, or set apart before or at the time of
the declaration, distribution, or setting apart with respect to the Junior
Stock. “Junior Stock” means the Common Stock and any series of Preferred Stock
that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or
liquidation, dissolution or winding up (whether voluntary or involuntary).

  

At any time that dividend payments due on one or more Dividend Payment Date on
any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are accumulated and unpaid, and
thereafter until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on any such Series A
Preferred Stock shall have been paid (without interest), we shall not redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire, retire or make a liquidation payment with
respect to any of our stock other than redemptions, repurchases, acquisitions,
retirements or liquidation payments with respect to the Series A Preferred
Stock and other series of Preferred Stock with similar redemption or
repurchase provisions that rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to
dividends and liquidation, dissolution or winding up (whether voluntary or
involuntary).

  

When dividends are not paid in full on any shares of outstanding Preferred
Stock that rank equal with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and
liquidation, dissolution or winding up (whether voluntary or involuntary) for
a dividend period, all dividends declared with respect to shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and all outstanding shares of such equal ranking Preferred
Stock for such dividend period shall be declared pro rata so that the
respective amounts of such dividends declared bear the same ratio to each
other as all accumulated but unpaid dividends per share on the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and all shares of such outstanding equal ranking
Preferred Stock for such dividend period bear to each other. Therefore, if we
are not paying full dividends on any outstanding shares of such equal ranking
Preferred Stock, we will not be able to pay full dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock. Similarly, if we issue any series of Preferred Stock that
ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and liquidation,
dissolution or winding up (whether voluntary or involuntary), we expect that
if we do not pay any amount of stated dividends thereon, we will not be able
to pay any dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.

  

Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as
may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on the
Common Stock and any other shares of Junior Stock (as defined below) from time
to time outstanding out of any funds legally available for such payment or as
otherwise permitted by applicable law, and the Series A Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.

  

Ranking

  

The Series A Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Common Stock as to
dividends, redemption, and amounts payable on our liquidation, dissolution or
winding up.

  

Except with respect to Preferred Stock issued in the future in accordance with
the provisions described under “Voting Rights—Restrictions on Issuance of
Senior Equity Securities,” the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock to
dividends, redemption, and amounts payable on our liquidation, dissolution or
winding up shall rank equal or senior to each other series of Preferred Stock
which we may issue in the future.

  

  

* * *

  

Redemption

  

Optional Redemption

  

We may redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock as follows:

  

•in whole but not in part, at any time and from time to time prior to October
15, 2024, within 120 days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process
instituted by us following the occurrence of a Ratings Event (as defined
herein), and the redemption price shall be equal to $25.50 per share, plus the
amount of accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends on such shares up to and
including the date on which the redemption price on such shares has been paid
in full; and/or

•in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after October
15, 2024, and the redemption price shall be equal to $25.00 per share, plus
the amount of accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends on such shares being
redeemed up to and including the date on which the redemption price on such
shares being redeemed has been paid in full.

  

Partial payments on any share will be applied first to preferred dividends and
then to the redemption price.

  

“Ratings Event” means that any nationally recognized statistical rating
organization as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or in any successor provision thereto, that then publishes a
rating for us (a “rating agency”) amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it
uses to assign equity credit to the Series A Preferred Stock, which amendment,
clarification or change results in:

  

•the shortening of the length of time the Series A Preferred Stock is assigned
a particular level of equity credit by that rating agency as compared to the
length of time the Series A Preferred Stock would have been assigned that
level of equity credit by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial
issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock; or

•the lowering of the equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) assigned
to the Series A Preferred Stock by that rating agency as compared to the
equity credit assigned thereto by that rating agency or its predecessor on the
initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  

Redemption Notice

  

At least 30 days and not more than 60 days before a redemption date, we will
mail or cause to be mailed written notice, postage prepaid, to each holder of
record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the holder’s
mailing address last shown on our share transfer records for the Series A
Preferred Stock. The redemption notice will state:

  

•the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that we will redeem on
the redemption date;

•the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the holder that we
will redeem on the redemption date;

•the redemption date and the redemption price;

•any conditions to such redemption; and

•the time, place, and manner in which the holder is to surrender to the
registrar the certificate or certificates representing shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

  

Conditions to Redemption

  

  

* * *

  

If the redemption notice shall specify conditions to redemption of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and such conditions shall not have been satisfied on
or prior to the redemption date, the redemption notice shall be of no force
and effect and such Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to
redemption on such redemption date.

  

Partial Redemption

  

In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot. Subject to the
provisions of the Resolution, we shall have full power and authority to
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares of Series A
Preferred Stock without charge to the holder thereof.

  

Termination of Rights

  

If the redemption notice is duly given and if, on or before the redemption
date, the redemption price is either paid or made available for payment on or
for the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption, then all
rights with respect to such shares will terminate immediately after the
redemption date, except the right of the holders of such shares to receive the
redemption price (without interest) on surrender of their certificates. This
termination of rights will not be affected by any failure to surrender on or
before the redemption date, any of the certificates representing the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event the redemption notice is duly given and a deposit of an amount
sufficient for redemption is made with a bank or trust company in accordance
with the TXBOC, rights with respect to such shares (other than the right to
receive payment of the redemption price without interest thereon from the bank
or trust company) shall terminate on the date of such deposit.

  

Liquidation Rights

  

In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, whether voluntary
or involuntary, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of our assets available for
distribution to our stockholders, whether such assets are capital, surplus, or
earnings, before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment of
any amount is made in respect of the Junior Stock.

  

The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be paid an amount per
share (the “Liquidation Value”) equal to the sum of $25.00 (subject to
appropriate adjustment to maintain the same aggregate accumulated dividend on,
and liquidation value of, the Series A Preferred Stock following any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization
affecting the shares of Series A Preferred Stock) plus an amount equal to all
accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends payable up to and including the
date full payment is tendered to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock with respect to the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, and no
more.

  

If, upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, whether voluntary or
involuntary, the assets distributed to the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and the holders of outstanding shares of other series of
Preferred Stock ranking equal to the Series A Preferred Stock as to
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up are insufficient to permit payment of
the full Liquidation Value thereof and the full liquidation value of the
outstanding shares of such other series of Preferred Stock, all of our assets
will be distributed ratably to each holder of outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and each holder of

  

* * *

  

outstanding shares of other series of Preferred Stock ranking equal to the
Series A Preferred Stock as to liquidation, dissolution, or winding upon the
basis of the Liquidation Value of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held
by each such holder and the liquidation value of the shares of such other
series of Preferred Stock.

  

Voting Rights

  

Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock Voting Together

  

Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote on all
matters as to which holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote, in
the same manner and with the same effect as such holders of the Common Stock,
voting together with the holders of the Common Stock and any other series of
Preferred Stock whose voting rights so provide as one class. Those shares of
Preferred Stock entitled to vote with the Common Stock, including the Series A
Preferred Stock, are referred to as “Voting Preferred Stock.” Regardless of
the number of issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and Common
Stock, so long as any Voting Preferred Stock is outstanding, issued and
outstanding Voting Preferred Stock shall possess at all times, in the
aggregate, 21% of the total votes of the issued and outstanding Common Stock
and Voting Preferred Stock combined, and the issued and outstanding Common
Stock shall possess at all times 79% of the total votes of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock and Voting Preferred Stock combined. The total number
of votes allocated to the Voting Preferred Stock shall be allocated among the
issued and outstanding shares of Voting Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis in
the same manner as if the holders of issued and outstanding Voting Preferred
Stock were all voting as a class as described below. So long as any Voting
Preferred Stock is outstanding, the total votes allocated to the holders of
Common Stock shall fluctuate from time to time depending on the number of
shares of Common Stock and Voting Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and
shall be calculated to be equal to that number of votes which would be 79% of
the total number of votes of Common Stock and Voting Preferred Stock combined
and shall be allocated among the shares of Common Stock on a pro rata basis.
If no Voting Preferred Stock is outstanding, each holder of Common Stock will
be entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by such holder.

  

Series A Preferred Stock Voting as a Class

  

For any vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock on a matter in
which they are entitled to vote, considered as a single class, each holder
will be entitled to one vote for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held
by such holder.

  

Preferred Stock Voting as a Class

  

For any vote of the holders of all series of Preferred Stock entitled to vote
on a matter considered as a single class, each holder of such Preferred Stock
will have a number of votes equal to the number of dollars equaling the
aggregate liquidation value of the Preferred Stock held by such holder. If a
series of Preferred Stock shall provide for different liquidation values in
the cases of voluntary liquidation and involuntary liquidation, for purpose of
the voting provisions, liquidation value shall mean the involuntary
liquidation value for Preferred Stock of such series.

  

Election of Additional Directors

  

In addition to the voting powers expressly conferred upon the Series A
Preferred Stock as described herein and in addition to voting rights granted
to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in statutory proceedings as to
which their vote may be mandatorily required by the then-existing laws of the
State of Texas and which is not permitted to be modified and so modified under
the Resolution, in case at

  

* * *

  

any time we shall fail to declare and pay or set aside for payment in full
dividend payments due on the Series A Preferred Stock on six Dividend Payment
Dates whether or not consecutive and thereafter until all dividends
accumulated and payable on the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been fully
paid without interest, then in each case, such holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock and all other series of Preferred Stock hereafter established
with provisions corresponding to those described herein for the election of
additional directors shall thereupon have and continue to have, the right,
voting together as a class for such purpose by vote of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast thereon by such holders of Preferred Stock, to elect two
additional directors to our Board of Directors (the “Additional Directors”),
such that the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors
shall automatically be increased by two; and, during the continuance of such
right of the holders of series of Preferred Stock to elect the Additional
Directors, the remaining directors shall continue to be elected as provided
under the Charter, the Bylaws and the laws of the State of Texas.

  

Upon the termination at any time of such right of the holders of Preferred
Stock entitled to vote thereon to elect Additional Directors, the term of
office of the Additional Directors shall end.

  

Restriction on Issuance of Senior Equity Securities

  

So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, we
shall not create, authorize or issue any new stock that, after issuance, would
rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or in liquidation,
dissolution or winding up (whether voluntary or involuntary) without the prior
written consent, voting as a single class, of at least two-thirds of the votes
entitled to be cast thereon by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and
any other outstanding series of Preferred Stock ranking equal to the Series A
Preferred Stock as to dividends or in liquidation, dissolution or winding up
(whether voluntary or involuntary) (including the Series A Preferred Stock).

  

Amendments or Waivers

  

So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
prior written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the votes
entitled to be cast thereon by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock,
voting as a separate class, shall be required for any amendment, modification
or waiver of the provisions of the Charter (including the terms of the Series
A Preferred Stock) insofar as such amendment, modification or waiver amends,
modifies or waives a provision in a manner prejudicial in any material respect
to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that, if
more than one series of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding and if such
amendment, modification or waiver would be correspondingly prejudicial to the
rights of the holders of other series of Preferred Stock, in lieu of the
separate class vote of the Series A Preferred Stock, the prior written consent
or vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast thereon by the
holders of all series of Preferred Stock so affected considered as a single
class shall be required for such amendment, modification or waiver. For all
purposes described in this paragraph, any increase in the amount of the
authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized Preferred Stock,
or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking equal with or junior to
the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether
such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the distribution of assets
upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs will not be
deemed to materially and prejudicially affect the special rights, preferences,
privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  

Elimination of Need for Formal Meetings

  

In accordance with Section 6.202 of the TXBOC, our Charter allows the taking
of action without holding a meeting, providing notice, or taking a vote if
stockholders having at least the minimum number

  

* * *

  

of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which the
holders of all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted,
sign a written consent or consents stating the action taken.

  

Transfer Agent, Registrar and Paying Agent

  

Equiniti Trust Company, doing business as EQ Shareholder Services, is
currently the transfer agent, registrar and paying agent for the Series A
Preferred Stock.

  

Book-Entry Only Issuance—The Depository Trust Company

  

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) is currently the securities depository
for the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock is represented
by a global certificate registered in the name of Cede & Co., DTC’s nominee.
The global certificate was deposited with the transfer agent as custodian for
DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global certificate is limited to
institutions that have accounts with DTC or its participants or persons that
may hold interests through participants.

  

DTC is a New York clearing corporation and a clearing agency registered under
Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds
securities for its participants. DTC also facilitates the post-trade
settlement of securities transactions among its participants through
electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges in the participants’
accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation
(“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing
Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.
Others who maintain a custodial relationship with a participant can use the
DTC system. The rules that apply to DTC and those using its systems are on
file with the SEC.

  

Purchases of the Series A Preferred Stock within the DTC system must be made
through participants, who will receive a credit for the Series A Preferred
Stock on DTC’s records. The beneficial ownership interest of each purchaser
will be recorded on the appropriate participant’s records. Beneficial owners
do not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but
beneficial owners should receive written confirmations of the transactions, as
well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the participants through
whom they purchased Series A Preferred Stock. Transfers of ownership in the
Series A Preferred Stock are to be accomplished by entries made on the books
of the participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners
will not receive certificates for their Series A Preferred Stock, except if
use of the book-entry system for the Series A Preferred Stock is discontinued.

  

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock
deposited by participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s
nominee, Cede & Co. The deposit of the Series A Preferred Stock with DTC and
its registration in the name of Cede & Co. effects no change in beneficial
ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the Series
A Preferred Stock. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the participants
to whose accounts such Series A Preferred Stock is credited. These
participants may or may not be the beneficial owners. Participants are
responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their
customers.

  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, and by
participants to beneficial owners, will be governed by arrangements among
them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect
from time to time. Beneficial owners of Series A Preferred Stock may wish to
take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant
events with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. Beneficial owners of the
Series A Preferred Stock may wish to ascertain that

  

* * *

  

the nominee holding the Series A Preferred Stock has agreed to obtain and
transmit notices to the beneficial owners.

  

Redemption notices will be sent to Cede & Co., as registered holder of the
Series A Preferred Stock. If less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of
interest of each participant in such Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will itself consent or vote with respect to the
Series A Preferred Stock, unless authorized by a participant in accordance
with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus
proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy
assigns the consenting or voting rights of Cede & Co. to those participants to
whose accounts the Series A Preferred Stock is credited on the record date. We
believe that these arrangements will enable the beneficial owners to exercise
rights equivalent in substance to the rights that can be directly exercised by
a registered holder of the Series A Preferred Stock.

  

Payments on the Series A Preferred Stock are and will be made to Cede & Co.,
or such other nominee as may be requested by DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit
participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail
information from us or our agent, on the payable date in accordance with their
respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by participants to
beneficial owners are and will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices. Payments are the responsibility of participants and not
of DTC or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time. Payment to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may
be requested by DTC) is our responsibility. Disbursement of payments to
participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of payments to the
beneficial owners is the responsibility of participants.

  

Other than in the circumstances described herein, a beneficial owner of a
global share of Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive
physical delivery of Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, each beneficial
owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights under the
Series A Preferred Stock.

  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock at any time by giving us reasonable
notice. In the event no successor securities depositary is obtained,
certificates for the Series A Preferred Stock will be printed and delivered.
We may decide to replace DTC or any successor depositary. Additionally,
subject to the procedures of DTC, we may decide to discontinue use of the
system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor depositary) with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. We understand, however, that under
current industry practices, DTC would notify its participants of our decision,
but will only withdraw beneficial interests from global shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at the request of each participant. In that event,
certificates for the Series A Preferred Stock will be printed and delivered.

  

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has
been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we do not take
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

2021-2023 Performance Unit Agreement (“Agreement”)

Under the 2019 Entergy Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan

  

Pursuant to the 2019 Entergy Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”),
you are eligible to participate at a target Achievement Level (as defined
below) of that number of performance units (subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 3 of this Agreement, the “Target Performance Units”) (based upon an
Achievement Level of 100%) set forth under the heading “Total Granted” on the
Performance Unit Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached (the “Grant
Notice”) for the performance period commencing January 1, 2021 and ending
December 31, 2023 (the “Performance Period”), subject to the terms of the Plan
and to the following terms and conditions:

  

1\. Effective Date of Agreement; Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Performance
Units. This Agreement is effective as of the Award Date set forth on the Grant
Notice, contingent upon your acceptance of this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Grant Notice. The effectiveness of this
Agreement is subject to your electronically acknowledging and accepting this
Agreement and all of its terms and conditions and the terms of the Plan in the
manner and at the time set forth on the Grant Notice. If you do not timely
acknowledge and accept this Agreement in accordance with the Grant Notice, the
Company shall be entitled to unilaterally cancel and render void this
Agreement and the Grant Notice.

  

2\. Achievement Levels. The Personnel Committee of the Board (the “Committee”)
shall determine the achievement level attained by the Company for the
Performance Period (the “Achievement Level”) based (i) eighty percent (80%) on
TSR Achievement Level (as defined below); and (ii) twenty percent (20%) on
Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level (as defined below). The weighted
average of the two performance measures will determine the Achievement Level
and overall payout for the Performance Period. For these purposes, and subject
to the terms of the Plan, the Achievement Level shall be determined as
follows:

  

a.The “TSR Achievement Level” shall be determined by comparing the Company’s
“total shareholder return” for the Performance Period (“Company TSR”) to that
of the peer group companies comprising the Philadelphia Electric Utilities
Index (the “Peer Group”). For this purpose, subject to the terms of the Plan,
“total shareholder return” shall be determined in accordance with Company
administrative practice based on the changes in the stock price and dividends
over the course of the Performance Period. The possible TSR Achievement Levels
for the Performance Period shall be determined as follows: for bottom quartile
performance (where Company TSR is in the fourth or bottom quartile of Peer
Group TSR), the TSR Achievement Level is zero percent; for third quartile
performance (where Company TSR is in the third quartile of Peer Group TSR),
the TSR Achievement Level is determined by interpolating between index median
(100% TSR Achievement Level) and the performance of the Peer Group company at
the top of the fourth quartile, starting at 25% TSR Achievement Level; for
second quartile performance (where Company TSR is in the second quartile of
Peer Group TSR), the TSR

  

* * *

  

Achievement Level is determined by interpolating between the performance of
the Peer Group Company at the bottom of the top quartile (200% TSR Achievement
Level) and index median (100% TSR Achievement Level); and for top quartile
performance (where Company TSR is in the first or top quartile of Peer Group
TSR), the TSR Achievement Level is 200%.

  

b. The Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level” shall be determined by
comparing, as of December 31st for each year in the Performance Period (1) the
quotient of (x) FFO (as defined below) divided by (y) the Company’s
consolidated debt, excluding securitization debt (or debt outstanding that is
pending securitization) and adjusting for pre-defined exclusions and other
adjustments determined by the Committee (such quotient, the “Annual Adjusted
FFO/Debt Ratio”) to (2) the adjusted FFO/debt ratio achievement levels
established by the Committee for such year as “Target,” (target Adjusted
FFO/Debt Ratio), “Minimum,” and “Maximum.” For an Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt
Ratio less than the Minimum, the Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement
Level is zero percent. For an Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio equal to the
Minimum, the Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level is 25%. For an
Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio equal to the target Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio,
the Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level is 100%. For an Annual
Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio greater than or equal to the Maximum, the Annual
Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level is 200%. For an Annual Adjusted
FFO/Debt Ratio that is greater than the Minimum and less than the Target, the
Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level shall be determined by
straight line interpolation between the Minimum and the Target. For an Annual
Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio that is greater than the Target and less than the
Maximum, the Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level shall be
determined by straight line interpolation between the Target and the Maximum.
The final “Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level” for the Performance
Period shall be equal to the average of the Annual Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratios
determined for each year in the Performance Period. Subject to the terms of
the Plan and such adjustments as set forth in this Section 2, these
determinations shall be made by the Committee in accordance with Company
administrative practice. “FFO” means the Company’s consolidated operating cash
flow, adjusted for its allowance for funds used during construction, working
capital amounts, the effects of securitization revenue, and certain pre-
defined exclusions determined by the Committee.

  

c. The Achievement Level shall be equal to the sum of (1) and (2), where (1)
is equal to 80% of the TSR Achievement Level, as calculated in Section 2.a.
and (2) is equal to 20% of the Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio Achievement Level, as
calculated in Section 2.b. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Achievement Level shall be adjusted for such items as the Committee may
determine in its discretion during or after the Performance Period (but in any
event before any delivery of Shares hereunder), whether resulting in an
increase or decrease (including to zero (0)) in the number of Shares otherwise
deliverable hereunder, considering management accountability and business
rationale.

  

3\. Performance Units Earned. The actual number of performance units awarded
to you under this Agreement, if any (the “Performance Units”), shall be
calculated by the Committee at the end of the Performance Period by
multiplying the Target Performance Units by the percentage of the Company’s
attained Achievement Level, determined as described above. Unless otherwise
provided in the Plan or this Agreement, to earn Performance Units you must (i)
remain a full-time employee of a System Company for the remainder of the
Performance Period, (ii) maintain your current System Management Level (“ML”)
1-4 role and, as applicable, current role within the Office of the Chief
Executive (each an “Eligible Role”), resulting in an award opportunity
dependent on your specific ML or Office of the Chief Executive role
(“Eligibility Level”); and (iii) comply with Section 10 of this Agreement.

  

  

* * *

  

Except as provided below for an employee on an extended leave of absence
bridge to retirement under an approved severance program under the Entergy
System Severance Pay Plan No. 537 or the Entergy System Severance Pay Plan No.
538, if you are approved by your System Company employer for a leave of
absence (whether paid or unpaid) for reasons other than Disability or are a
continuous part-time regular System Company employee participating in the
phased retirement program under the Entergy System Policies & Procedures
Phased Retirement – Pre-Separation Policy (the “Phased Retirement Program”),
you will continue to be treated as a full-time employee of a System Company
while you are on such approved leave of absence for purposes of the Plan and
this Agreement or during such participation in the Phased Retirement Program,
as applicable. If you are on an extended leave of absence bridge to retirement
under an approved severance program offered pursuant to Entergy System
Severance Pay Plan No. 537 or Entergy System Severance Pay Plan No. 538, you
will not be considered under the Plan or this Agreement to be a full-time
employee during the extended leave of absence bridge period or a part-time
System Company employee under the Phased Retirement Program during the
extended leave of absence bridge period, and your System Company employment
will be considered terminated for purposes of vesting in Awards under this
Agreement as of the commencement of your extended leave of absence bridge
period.

  

If you have completed a minimum of twelve months of full-time employment in an
Eligible Role during the Performance Period and you Retire, you will be
eligible for a prorated portion of the applicable Achievement Level of
Performance Units, based on your full months of participation and your
Eligibility Level(s) during the Performance Period. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, you will have “Retired” if you incur a separation from
service with the System Companies and at the time of such separation from
service, either (A) you are eligible to commence retirement benefits under a
System Company-sponsored qualified final average pay defined benefit pension
plan or (B) you have attained age 65 or have attained age 55 with ten (10) or
more years of service with System Companies that is considered vesting service
under the System Company-sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plan in
which you actively participate or, if none, the System Company-sponsored
qualified defined contribution pension plan in which you actively participate.
If your employment terminates due to your incurring a Disability or you die
during the Performance Period, you (or your Beneficiary or heirs) will be
eligible for a prorated portion of the applicable Achievement Level of
Performance Units, based on your full months of full-time employment prior to
your Disability or death and your Eligibility Level(s) during the Performance
Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if, during the
Performance Period (x) your employment is terminated for Cause or (y) the
Committee or its delegee determines that you engaged in an activity that would
constitute Cause, then you shall not be entitled to receive any Performance
Units pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Regardless of eligibility, you shall not be entitled to receipt of nor vest in
any Performance Units and/or any dividends that have accrued on any
Performance Units unless and until the Personnel Committee has certified the
Achievement Level after the close of the Performance Period.

  

If you are promoted during the Performance Period, then the number of Target
Performance Units set forth on the Grant Notice shall be adjusted (but not
downward) to reflect the number of full months during the Performance Period
for which you were eligible hereunder in each Eligibility Level, and the
number of Performance Units, if any, awarded to you will be prorated to
reflect the number of full months you earned Performance Units at each
Eligibility Level.

  

If you are demoted during the Performance Period, but you remain in an
Eligible Role following such demotion, then the number of Target Performance
Units set forth on the Grant Notice shall be adjusted (but not upward ) to
reflect the number of full months during the Performance Period for which you
were eligible hereunder in each Eligibility Level, and the number of
Performance Units, if any, awarded to you will be prorated to reflect the
number of full months you earned Performance Units at each Eligibility Level.

  

  

* * *

  

If any change to an Eligibility Level is effective on a date other than the
first day of a calendar month, the number of Performance Units, if any,
awarded to you with respect to the transition month in accordance with this
Section 3 will be determined based on your prior Eligibility Level.

If you are demoted to a position that is not an Eligible Role or you are
otherwise no longer in an Eligible Role during the Performance Period, but
remain employed on a regular full-time basis by a System Company for the
duration of the Performance Period, the number of Performance Units, if any,
awarded to you will be prorated to reflect only the number of full months you
earned Performance Units in an Eligible Role in accordance with your
Eligibility Level(s).

  

4\. Accelerated Change in Control Vesting. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary:

  

a.in the event that (i) a Change in Control occurs and (ii) either (x)
outstanding Target Performance Units are not assumed or substituted in
connection therewith as described in Section 12(b) of the Plan, or (y)
outstanding Target Performance Units are so assumed or substituted in
connection therewith and your employment or service is terminated by your
System Company employer without Cause or by you for Good Reason on or after
the effective date of the Change in Control but prior to twenty-four (24)
months following the Change in Control (the date on which (x) or (y) occurs,
the “CIC Vesting Date”), then (A) the Committee shall calculate the
Achievement Level for the Performance Period during which the CIC Vesting Date
occurs treating the CIC Vesting Date as if it were the last day of the
Performance Period (the “CIC Achievement Level”) and you shall immediately
become fully vested in that number of Performance Units calculated by
multiplying the Adjusted Target Performance Units (as defined below) by the
percentage of the Company’s attained Achievement Level that is the greater of
Target Achievement Level or CIC Achievement Level and (B) the restrictive
covenants set forth in Sections 10.b., 10.c., 10.d., and 10.e. of this
Agreement shall cease to apply as of the CIC Vesting Date. In the event of
accelerated vesting as described in this Section 4.a., but subject to the
conditions and limitations described herein and subject to Section 5 of the
Plan, the Company shall pay you a number of Shares equal to the number of
Performance Units that vest in accordance with this Section 4.a. no later than
sixty (60) days after the CIC Vesting Date; provided, that if such 60-day
period straddles two of your taxable years, the payment shall be made in the
later year. “Adjusted Target Performance Units” means that number of units
calculated by multiplying the Target Performance Units by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period up to and
including the CIC Vesting Date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Performance Period.

b.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the time and form of any
payments to which you may be entitled pursuant to this Section 4 are subject
to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 22 of the Plan.

  

5\. Dividend Equivalents. If you are awarded Performance Units pursuant to
this Agreement, you will also be awarded the dividend equivalents attributable
to such awarded Performance Units for the time you were a Participant in an
Eligible Role and at the Eligibility Level underlying such Performance Units
(“Dividend Equivalents”). The Dividend Equivalents with respect to each
awarded Performance Unit will be equal to only the dividends paid with respect
to a Share for the period of your participation in the Plan at an Eligible
Role during the Performance Period.

  

6\. Settlement of Performance Units and Dividend Equivalents.

  

a.As soon as reasonably practicable following the date on which the Committee
determines the number of Performance Units, if any, to be awarded to you under
this Agreement and no later than March 15th following the end of the calendar
year in which the Performance Units are no longer

subject to a “substantial risk of forfeiture” within the meaning of Code
Section 409A, the Company shall issue to you, after withholding all applicable
income tax and employment tax amounts required to be withheld in connection
with such payment in accordance with Section 6.d. of this Agreement: (i) one
Share for each Performance Unit so determined to be awarded, and (ii) an
additional number of Shares determined by dividing the total Dividend
Equivalents with respect to such awarded Performance Units by the closing
share price of a Share on the last trading date of the Performance Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Dividend Equivalents are awarded with
respect to Performance Units that are payable pursuant to Section 4.a., the
number of Shares issuable pursuant to this Section 6 in respect of such
Dividend Equivalents shall be calculated treating the CIC Vesting Date as the
last day of the Performance Period and shall be issued no later than sixty
(60) days after the CIC Vesting Date; provided, that if such 60-day period
straddles two of your taxable years, such Shares shall be issued in the later
year.

  

b.Shares (including any Dividend Equivalents that are settled in Shares) shall
be credited to a separate book entry account in your name, and such vested
Shares shall be free of all restrictions except any that may be imposed by
law. Upon the crediting of vested Shares to a book entry account, you may
treat the Shares in the same manner as all other shares of Common Stock owned
by you, subject to the provisions of Section 6.c. below. All ML 1-4
Participants are considered Restricted Employees under Entergy’s Insider
Trading Policy and, as such, may trade in Entergy Corporation securities only
during an open window period (and only if not in possession of material, non-
public information). Generally, window periods begin on the second business
day after the quarterly earnings release and end at the close of trading on
the 15th day of the third month of the Company’s fiscal quarter or, if such
day is not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day. In addition, if
you are a Restricted Employee, the Insider Trading Policy requires that you
pre-clear all transactions involving Entergy securities with Entergy
Corporation’s Office of the General Counsel.

  

c.Share Ownership Guidelines. All ML 1-4 Participants must maintain the
applicable Common Stock Ownership Target Level in the chart below, which is
expressed as a multiple of your base salary and depends on your management
level.

  

| |  |  |  |  | |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|System Management Level | Common Stock Ownership Target Level |  |  |  | |
|ML 1 | 6 times base salary |  |  |  | |
|ML 2 | 3 times base salary |  |  |  | |
|ML 3 | 2 times base salary |  |  |  | |
|ML 4 | 1 times base salary |  |  |  | |
  
  
  

These ownership multiples may be satisfied through any shares of Common Stock
held by the ML 1-4 Participant, including those Shares earned during this
Performance Period, all Restricted Shares, shares of Common Stock held in tax-
qualified 401(k) plans, etc. You must continue to retain the book entry Shares
issued to you pursuant to this Agreement until the earlier of (i) achieving
and maintaining your applicable Common Stock Ownership Target Level, or (ii)
your termination of full-time employment with all System Companies. Once you
have achieved and maintain your applicable Common Stock Ownership Target
Level, you are no longer bound to hold the Shares earned during this
Performance Period in book entry. However, you are still subject to the
trading restrictions and pre-clearance requirements in transacting in these
Shares described in Section 6.b. of this Agreement.

  

d.Withholding Taxes. The Company shall use the “net shares method” to satisfy
any tax withholding obligation in respect of any payment under this Agreement,
which means the Company will reduce the number of earned Shares otherwise
payable to you by the amount necessary to cover up to the maximum amount of
such obligation in any applicable jurisdiction. In

  

* * *

  

no event shall the Company or any other System Company have any liability to
you for your individual income tax liability, for withholding or failing to
withhold taxes, or for remitting or failing to remit taxes with respect to
your income, including without limitation, in the event that you are subject
to penalty tax pursuant to Code Section 409A.

  

e.No Fractional Shares. Any fractional Share to be distributed shall be
settled in cash and applied to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The
Company will not pay out any fractional Shares.

  

7\. Termination of Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the
Plan, this Agreement (other than the restrictive covenants set forth in
Section 10) and your Target Performance Units award opportunity shall
terminate and be forfeited on the date on which your full-time System Company
employment terminates.

  

8\. Performance Units Nontransferable. Your Target Performance Units award
opportunity and any Performance Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement may
not be sold, exchanged, pledged, transferred, assigned, or otherwise
encumbered, hypothecated or disposed of by you (or your beneficiary) other
than by will or laws of descent and distribution.

  

9\. Entergy Policies.

  

a.Hedging Policy. Pursuant to the Entergy Corporation Policy Relating to
Hedging, as adopted by the Board at its meeting held on December 3, 2010, and
as in effect on the date hereof, officers, directors and employees are
prohibited from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving
Common Stock so they continue to own Common Stock with the full risks and
rewards of ownership, thereby ensuring continued alignment of their objectives
with the Company’s other shareholders. Participation in any hedging
transaction with respect to Common Stock (including Target Performance Units
or Performance Units) is prohibited.

  

b.Recoupment Policy; Dodd-Frank; Payment in Error. Pursuant to the Entergy
Corporation Policy Relating to Recoupment of Certain Compensation, as adopted
by the Board at its meeting held on December 3, 2010, and as in effect on the
date hereof, the Company is allowed to seek reimbursement of certain incentive
compensation (including Performance Units and Shares issued in payment of
Performance Units) from “executive officers” for purposes of Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, if the Company is required to
restate its financial statements due to material noncompliance with any
financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws (other than
corrections resulting from changes to accounting standards) or there is a
material miscalculation of a performance measure relative to incentive
compensation, regardless of the requirement to restate the financial
statements; or the Board determines that an executive officer engaged in fraud
resulting in either a restatement of the Company’s financial statements or a
material miscalculation of a performance measure relative to incentive
compensation whether or not the financial statements were restated. In
addition, the Performance Units (and Shares issued in payment of Performance
Units) are subject to any forfeiture and/or recoupment policy which the
Company has adopted or may adopt under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and implementing rules and regulations
thereunder, or as may be required by applicable law. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, in the event that a payment is made to you
(whether in cash, stock or other property) in error that exceeds the amount to
which you are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Plan,
including without limitation pursuant to Section 28 of the Plan (such excess
amount, an “Excess Payment”), you will repay to the Company, and the Company
shall have the right to recoup from you such Excess Payment by notifying you
in writing of the nature and amount of such Excess Payment together with (i)
demand for direct repayment to the

  

* * *

  

Company by you in the amount of such Excess Payment or (ii) reduction of any
amount(s) owed to you by the Company or any other System Company by the amount
of the Excess Payment.

  

10. Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenants. In consideration of the grant to you of the Target Performance Units award opportunity set forth herein and any Performance Units awarded to you pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby agree to the following restrictive covenants:

  

a.Confidential Information. You acknowledge that the System Companies have
unique methods and processes for the generation, transmission and distribution
and sale of energy and energy-related products, which give the System
Companies a competitive advantage, including strategic and non-public plans
for their products, geographic and customer markets, and for marketing,
distributing and selling their products. You further acknowledge that you have
held a position of confidence and trust with respect to the System Companies
and that you have and will acquire additional detailed knowledge of the System
Companies’ unique and confidential methods of doing business and plans for the
future. You acknowledge that the System Companies are expending and will
continue to expend substantial amounts of time, money and effort to develop
effective business and regulatory strategies, methodologies and technology.
You also acknowledge that the System Companies have a compelling business
interest in protecting the System Companies’ Confidential Information (as
defined below) and that the System Companies would be seriously and
irreparably damaged by the improper disclosure of Confidential Information.
You therefore agree that, during your employment or other service with any
System Company and at all times thereafter, you will hold in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of the System Companies and, other than as authorized
in writing by the General Counsel of the Company or as required by law or in
the proper performance of your duties and responsibilities, or as otherwise
provided in this Section 10, you will not disclose, directly or indirectly, to
any person or entity, or use, Confidential Information for any purpose other
than the furtherance of your responsibilities to any System Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means information that
is not generally known by persons outside the System Companies and could not
easily be determined or learned by someone outside the System Companies,
including without limitation, any and all information and knowledge, whether
or not explicitly designated as confidential and whether or not reduced to
writing, regarding the System Companies’ business, including, without
limitation, (i) the generation, transmission, brokering, marketing,
distribution, sale and delivery of electric power or natural gas (through
regulated utilities or otherwise), (ii) the System Companies’ ownership,
development, management or operation of power plants and power generation
facilities (including, without limitation, nuclear power plants), and the
provision of operations and management services (including, without
limitation, decommissioning services) with respect to power plants, and the
sale of the electric power produced by the System Companies’ operating plants
to wholesale customers, (iii) the System Companies’ proprietary methods and
methodology, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research and development
information, product plans, customer lists, specific information relating to
products, services and customers or prospective customers (including, but not
limited to, customers or prospective customers of any System Company with whom
you became or become acquainted during your relationship with any System
Company), books and records of any System Company, corporate, regulatory,
customer and strategic relationships, suppliers, markets, computer software,
computer software development, inventions, processes, formulae, technology,
designs, drawings, technical information, source codes, engineering
information, hardware configuration information, and matters of a business
nature such as information regarding marketing, costs, pricing, finances,
financial models and projections, billings, new or existing business or
economic development plans, initiatives, and opportunities, or any other
similar business information made available to you in connection with your
relationship with any System Company and (iv) any attorney-client privileged
information of a System Company. Confidential Information shall also include
non-public information concerning any director, officer, employee,
shareholder, or partner of any System Company. You agree that your obligation
not to disclose or use Confidential Information, and your obligation, detailed
below, to return and, upon your termination of employment with all System
Companies, not to retain materials and tangible property described in this
Section shall also extend to such

  

* * *

  

types of information, materials and tangible property of customers of and
suppliers to the System Companies and to other third parties, in each case who
may have disclosed or entrusted the same to you or to any System Company
during your employment with any System Company.

  

b.Non-Competition. You agree that (i) at all times during the period of your
employment or service with any System Company employer, and (ii) for one (1)
year following the termination for any reason of your employment by or service
with your last System Company employer ((i) and (ii) collectively, as
applicable, the “Non-Compete Period”), you will not engage in Competing
Employment. For purposes of this Section 10, “Competing Employment” means
working for, providing services to or otherwise directly or indirectly
assisting (whether or not for compensation) any person, entity or business
which directly or indirectly competes with any part of the System Company
business, and such employment or services involves products, services and
business activities that are the same as or similar to those you provided to a
System Company, or as to which you had access to Confidential Information, in
the two years preceding your termination of employment or service with all
System Companies. You agree that it is reasonable for the restriction
contained in this paragraph to apply in each and every county, province,
state, city, parish or other political subdivision or territory of the United
States in which any System Company engages in any business activity, or
otherwise distributes, licenses or sells its products or services, including,
without limitation, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Texas, and Vermont
and any other state in which any System Company engages in business at any
time and, with respect to the State of Louisiana, means the following
Parishes: Acadia, Allen, Ascension, Assumption, Avoyelles, Beauregard,
Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Calcasieu, Caldwell, Cameron, Catahoula, Claiborne,
Concordia, De Soto, East Baton Rouge, East Carroll, East Feliciana,
Evangeline, Franklin, Grant, Iberia, Iberville, Jackson, Jefferson, Jefferson
Davis, Lafayette, Lafourche, La Salle, Lincoln, Livingston, Madison,
Morehouse, Natchitoches, Orleans, Ouachita, Plaquemines, Point Coupee,
Rapides, Red River, Richland, Sabine, Saint Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena,
Saint James, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Landry, Saint Martin, Saint Mary,
Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, Tensas, Terrebonne, Union, Vermilion, Vernon,
Washington, Webster, West Baton Rouge, West Carroll, West Feliciana and Winn
(collectively, the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
your employment is terminated by any System Company employer without Cause,
the covenant not to compete set forth in this Section 10.b. shall apply only
for as long as the System Company employer continues to pay you, in accordance
with the System Company employer’s regular payroll practices and schedule,
your bi-weekly base salary in effect on the effective date of the termination
of your employment, less any applicable tax withholdings and ordinary
deductions (such payments, the “Non-Compete Payments”), but in no such event
for longer than the Non-Compete Period. In any instance where a System Company
employer has the right to elect to make Non-Compete Payments, such System
Company employer must notify you in writing of such election, and the duration
for which it elects to make Non-Compete Payments, within ten (10) business
days following the termination of your employment from all System Company
employment. If the System Company Employer elects to make the Non-Compete
Payments for less than the full Non-Compete Period, you shall be free to join
a competitor after you cease receiving the Non-Compete Payments. For purposes
of clarity, in the event of your termination for Cause or voluntary
resignation, you shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Section 10.b. without any requirement that your System Company employer pay
you any Non-Compete Payments.

  

c.Non-Solicitation. You agree that, while you are employed by any System
Company and during the Non-Compete Period (or, if later, the last day you are
scheduled to receive cash severance payments from your System Company employer
pursuant to any severance plan or other agreement), except in the good faith
performance of your duties to the System Companies, you shall not, other than
as authorized in writing by the General Counsel of the Company: (i) directly
or indirectly, solicit or seek to hire or identify for potential hiring
(whether on your own behalf or on behalf of any other person, entity or
organization) any person who is at that time (or was during the prior six (6)
months) an employee or consultant of any System Company, or (ii) within the
Restricted Territory, directly or indirectly solicit the trade, business or
patronage of any

  

* * *

  

clients, customers or vendors or prospective clients, customers or vendors of
any System Company to provide competing products or services or advise, or
assist such clients, customers or vendors or prospective clients, customers or
vendors to in any way modify their relationship with any System Company. The
foregoing non-solicitation (1) shall not be violated by general advertising
not targeted at the forgoing persons or entities; (2) shall not apply to
solicitation of persons involuntarily terminated from System Company
employment; and (3) shall only apply to persons or entities (A) who reported
directly or indirectly to you; (B) with whom you had material contact while at
a System Company; or (C) about whom or which you possessed (i) information
regarding quality of performance while they were employed by or performing
services for a System Company, which information you would not otherwise have
except for the position you held with a System Company, or (ii) Confidential
Information.

  

d.Non-Disparagement. You agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, you will not at any time (whether during or after your
employment or service with any System Company), other than in the proper
performance of your duties, publish or communicate to any person or entity any
“Disparaging” (as defined below) remarks, comments or statements concerning
any System Company or any of their respective directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, agents, attorneys, successors and assigns.
“Disparaging” remarks, comments or statements are those that are intended to,
or could be construed in a manner so as to, impugn, discredit, injure or
impair the business, reputation, character, honesty, integrity, judgment,
morality or business acumen or abilities of the individual or entity being
disparaged.

  

e.System Company Property. All tangible materials, equipment, devices,
documents, copies of documents, data compilations (in whatever form), software
programs, and electronically created or stored materials that you receive or
create in the course of employment with a System Company are and shall remain
the property of the System Company and you shall immediately return (and/or
cooperate in the supervised deletion of) such property to your System Company
employer upon the termination of your employment, for whatever reason. The
obligation to return property and documents extends to anything received or
made during and as a result of employment by a System Company, regardless of
whether it was received from a System Company or a third party, such as an
actual or potential vendor or customer, and regardless of whether a document
contains Confidential Information. The only documents not subject to the
obligation to return are documents directly relating to your compensation and
benefits, such as your pay stubs and benefit plan information.

  

f.Violation of the Restrictive Covenant Section. In the event that you violate
any provision of this Section 10, the time periods set forth in those
paragraphs shall be extended for the period of time you remain in violation of
the provisions, to the greatest extent allowed by applicable law. The
provisions of Sections 10.a. – 10.e. hereof are, and shall be construed as,
independent covenants, and no claimed or actual breach of any contractual or
legal duty by any System Company shall excuse or terminate your obligations
hereunder or preclude any System Company from obtaining injunctive relief for
your violation, or threatened violation, of any of those provisions. You also
agree to indemnify and hold the System Companies harmless from any and all
losses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and other
expenses incurred to enforce this Agreement) suffered by any System Company as
a result of any violation or threatened violation of any of your
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings set forth in this
Agreement (in addition to any other remedies available to the System Companies
set forth in Section 10.i. below), provided that a System Company is found to
be the prevailing party in any such action.

  

g.Exclusions. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 10 or in this
Agreement to the contrary:

  

(i) The restrictive covenants in this Section 10 are not intended to restrict
you from cooperating with any investigation or proceeding initiated by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) or any other federal or state regulatory
agency. Further, you may make disclosure (A) to

  

* * *

  

exercise your rights as a whistleblower under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 21F-17(a), or any other federal or state law providing
whistleblower rights; (B) to the extent necessary when providing safety-
related or other information to the NRC on matters within the NRC’s regulatory
jurisdiction; (C) when participating in “protected activities,” as defined in
Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and in C.F.R. Part 50.7;
(D) when engaging in activities protected by the National Labor Relations Act
or any similar federal or state law; or (E) when required to do so by a court
of law, by any governmental agency or administrative or legislative body with
jurisdiction to order you to divulge, disclose or make accessible such
information. With the exception of Confidential Information subject to the
attorney-client privilege, you shall have no obligation to seek prior approval
of any System Company or to inform any System Company of such disclosure. This
Agreement does not limit your ability to communicate, without notice to any
System Company, with any government agencies or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency, or
to collect a reward in connection with any whistleblower information provided
to a government agency.

  

(ii) Defend Trade Secrets Act Immunity Notice. Pursuant to the Defend Trade
Secrets Act of 2016, non-compliance with the disclosure provisions of this
Agreement shall not subject you to criminal or civil liability under any
Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a System Company trade
secret: (A) in confidence to a Federal, State or local government official,
either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney in confidence solely for the
purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (B) in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, provided
that any complaint or document containing the trade secret is filed under
seal; or (C) to an attorney representing you in a lawsuit for retaliation by
any System Company for reporting a suspected violation of law or to use the
trade secret information in that court proceeding, provided that any document
containing the trade secret is filed under seal and you do not disclose the
trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

  

h.Restrictive Covenants Contained in Other Agreements. Notwithstanding any
provision contained herein to the contrary, to the extent that you are or
become subject to any other agreement that contains restrictive covenants
different from the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement, the
restrictive covenants set forth in such other agreement shall supplement, and
shall not replace, the restrictive covenants herein.

  

i.Enforcement. You hereby agree that the covenants set forth in this Section
10 are reasonable with respect to their scope, duration, and geographical
area. You further agree and acknowledge that the restrictions contained in
Section 10 do not and would not unreasonably impose limitations on your
ability to earn a living. If any court or other tribunal determines that any
term or provision of Section 10 is overbroad or otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, you and the Company hereby agree that such court or tribunal
shall have the power and obligation to narrow or otherwise reform the
unenforceable term or provision, including to delete, replace, or add specific
words or phrases, but only to the narrowest extent necessary to render the
provision valid and enforceable (provided that in no event shall the length of
any restrictive covenant or its scope be extended or expanded), and this
Agreement shall be fully enforceable as so modified. Your agreement to the
restrictions provided for in this Agreement and the Company’s agreement to
grant the Award are mutually dependent consideration. Therefore,
notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i)
the enforceability of any material restriction applicable to you as provided
for in this Section 10 is challenged and found unenforceable by a court or
other tribunal or (ii) you breach any of the provisions of Section 10, then
the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and recover from
you all Shares paid to you pursuant to this Agreement and if you have sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of any Shares paid to you pursuant to this
Agreement, an amount equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Shares
on the date such Shares were paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. This
provision shall be construed as a return of consideration or ill-gotten gains
due to the failure of your promises and consideration under the Agreement, and
not as a liquidated damages clause. In addition, in the event of the Company’s
termination of this Agreement, you shall immediately forfeit all unvested

  

* * *

  

Target Performance Units and your Target Performance Units award opportunity
under this Agreement. You further hereby agree that, in the event of a breach
by you of any of the provisions of Sections 10.a., 10.b., 10.c., 10.d., or
10.e., monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy.
Consequently, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the
Company or a System Company may, in addition to and without prejudice to other
rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof, without
the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages and without having
to demonstrate that money damages would be inadequate. You acknowledge (i)
that you have carefully read this Agreement and have given careful
consideration to the restraints imposed upon you by this Agreement, and you
are in full accord as to their necessity for the reasonable and proper
protection of the Confidential Information of the System Companies and their
relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners and (ii)
that you are informed in writing hereby that you have a right to the advice of
legal counsel and should consult with an attorney of your choice with regard
to this Agreement, and you have been provided ample opportunity to seek out
and consult with such counsel.

  

j.For purposes of this Section 10, “Company” shall include all System
Companies. You and the Company agree that each System Company is an intended
third-party beneficiary of this Section 10, and further agree that each System
Company is entitled to enforce the provisions of this Section 10 in accordance
with its terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the terms of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 10 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force
according to their respective terms.

  

k.In the twelve (12) months following the termination of your employment with
your last System Company employer, in the event you seek or obtain employment
or another business affiliation with any person or entity other than a System
Company, you agree to notify the Company in writing, as far in advance as is
reasonably practicable, but in no event less than two weeks prior to your
proposed commencement of employment, of the details of such employment or
business affiliation. You also agree to show these restrictive covenant
provisions to any prospective employer, and you consent to any System Company
showing these provisions to any third party believed by a System Company to be
a prospective or actual employer of you, or a receiver of services from you,
and to insisting on your compliance with these terms. Your obligations under
this Section 10.k. will expire on that date which is twelve months after the
end of your employment with all System Companies (or, if later, the last date
as of which you are scheduled to receive separation payments from any System
Company pursuant to a severance plan or other agreement).

  

11\. Governing Law/Court Proceedings. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of law of such state. Any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of, or with respect to this Agreement, its enforcement,
breach, or interpretation, shall be brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, and you and the
Company hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and its
appellate court, whether or not located in the State of Delaware) for the
purpose of any such suit, action, or proceeding. You and the Company hereby
irrevocably waive (i) any objections which each may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in
the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, (ii) any claim that any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and (iii) any right to a jury trial.

  

12\. Incorporation of Plan. The Plan is hereby incorporated by reference and
made a part hereof, and the Target Performance Units, your Target Performance
Units award opportunity under this Agreement, any Performance Units (and any
Dividend Equivalents) awarded pursuant to this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan, including, without
limitation, the amendment provisions thereof, and to such rules, regulations
and interpretations relating to the Plan as

  

* * *

  

may be adopted by the Committee and as may be in effect from time to time. Any
capitalized term that is not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning
set forth in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern, and this Agreement
shall be deemed to be modified accordingly, unless the Plan allows for such
modification of the Plan’s terms by this Agreement.

  

13\. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

14\. Rights as a Shareholder. Neither you nor any of your successors in
interest shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to
any Target Performance Units, your Target Performance Units award opportunity
under this Agreement, Performance Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement, or
Dividend Equivalents.

  

15\. Notices. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other
communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or by United States
registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, if to you, to your
last known address filed in the personnel records of the System Companies, and
if to the Company, to the address set forth below, or thereafter to such other
address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, except that any notice of change of address shall be
effective only upon actual receipt thereof:

  

If to the Company, by hand-delivery or email to:

  

Entergy Services, LLC

Attention: Executive Vice-President & General Counsel

639 Loyola Avenue, 28th Floor

New Orleans, LA 70113-3125

  

16\. Agreement Not a Contract of Employment. Your employment with your System
Company employer shall remain at will. Neither the Plan, the granting of the
Target Performance Units and/or Dividend Equivalents, the Grant Notice, this
Agreement nor any other action taken pursuant to the Plan shall constitute or
be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that you
have a right to continue as an employee of any System Company for any period
of time or at any specific rate of compensation.

  

17\. Authority of the Committee. The Committee shall have full authority and
discretion to interpret and construe the terms of the Plan, the Grant Notice,
and this Agreement. The determination of the Committee as to any such matter
of interpretation or construction shall be final, binding and conclusive.

  

18\. Compliance with Code Section 409A Limitations. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary, all provisions of the Grant Notice and this
Agreement shall be construed, administered and interpreted to comply with or
be exempt from Code Section 409A, and, if necessary, any provision shall be
held null and void to the extent such provision (or part thereof) fails to
comply with Code Section 409A or final regulations issued thereunder.
Specifically, the terms “termination” and “termination of employment” shall be
applied in a manner consistent with the definition of “separation from
service” within the meaning of Code Section 409A. A right of any System
Company, if any, to offset or otherwise reduce any sums that may be due or
become payable by any System Company to you by any overpayment or indebtedness
of yours shall be subject to limitations imposed by Code Section 409A. For
purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Code
Section 409A, each payment of

compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of
compensation for purposes of applying the Code Section 409A deferral election
rules and the exclusion from Code Section 409A for certain short-term deferral
amounts. Amounts payable under this Agreement shall be excludible from the
requirements of Code Section 409A, to the maximum possible extent, either as
(i) short-term deferral amounts (e.g., amounts payable no later than the 15th
day of the third month following the end of the taxable year of your System
Company employer in which such Performance Units are no longer subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture), or (ii) under the exclusion for involuntary
separation pay provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).
To the extent that deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Code
Section 409A becomes payable under this Agreement to you at a time when you
are a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), any such
payments shall be delayed by six months to the extent necessary to comply with
the requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B). The Company makes no
representation that any or all of the payments or benefits described in the
Plan or this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A
and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to any
such payment.

System Company. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently given for
the purposes of this Agreement if it is in writing signed by an authorized
Company officer. The failure of any System Company to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part
hereof or the right of any System Company thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

  

20\. Headings. The titles and headings of the sections in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only, do not form part of this Agreement, and
shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

  

21\. Electronic Signature. Electronic signature of this Agreement shall have

on its books a notional Matching Restoration Account for each Participant who
is credited with a Matching Restoration Credit.

  

4.02 Matching Restoration Credit. If a Participant is eligible to be allocated

respect of which the Participant receives Excess Earnings, then the
Participant’s Matching Restoration Account shall be credited with a Matching
Restoration Credit for the Plan Year in an amount equal to five percent (5%)

Matching Restoration Credits shall be determined and credited as soon as
administratively practicable following the end of the applicable Plan Year.

tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA amount, and to pay the
additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding
section 3401 wages and taxes. However, the total payment under this Section
4.05 must not exceed the aggregate of the FICA amount, and the income tax

ARTICLE V – ACCOUNTING, INVESTMENT AND VALUATION

  

  

* * *

  

5.01 Participant's Account. The Administrator shall create and maintain
adequate records to reflect the interest of each Participant in the Plan. Such
records shall be in the form of notional individual accounts, with each
Participant having a Matching Restoration Account and an Employer Retirement
Restoration Account. Such Accounts shall be kept for record-keeping purposes
only and shall not be construed as providing for assets to be held in trust or
escrow or any other form of asset segregation for the Participant or for any
Beneficiary to whom benefits are to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Plan.

  

5.02 Deemed Investment Direction of Participants. Subject to such limitations,
rules and procedures as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by
the Administrator, or contained elsewhere in the Plan, each Participant may
communicate to the Administrator, or to any person to whom the Administrator
has delegated such Administrative duties, a direction as to how the amounts
credited to his Account shall be deemed invested among the Investment Funds.
Such direction shall be subject to such rules and procedures for direction of
investments under the Savings Plan, as modified by the Administrator with
respect to the Plan. The Administrator may also designate default Investment
Funds in which a Participant’s Account shall be deemed invested if no
direction is received from the Participant (“Default Investment Funds”).
Unless otherwise designated by the Administrator, the Default Investment Funds
shall be the same as the default Investment Funds under the Savings Plan. No
Participant directions will be executed with respect to the deemed investment
of the Participant’s Account on or after the Valuation Date selected by the
Administrator to determine the amount of the payment from such Account under
Section 7.07 following the Participant’s Separation from Service. No actual
investment of the Participant’s Account shall be made in the Investment Funds,
and Participants shall have no right, claim or demand with respect to any such
Investment Funds based on the deemed investments under the Plan.

  

5.03 Allocation of Deemed Earnings or Losses on Accounts. The Administrator,
or any person to whom the Administrator has delegated such Administrative
duties, shall maintain records that track or replicate the performance of the
Participant’s Account’s deemed investments in the Investment Funds. As of each
Valuation Date, the Participant's Account shall be credited with the increase
or decrease since the most recent preceding Valuation Date in the net asset
value of the Investment Funds in which the Participant’s Account is deemed to
be invested. Any deemed dividends or capital gain distributions with respect
to a Participant’s Account’s deemed investment in an Investment Fund shall be
deemed to be reinvested in the applicable Investment Fund. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, deemed dividends and capital gain distributions with
respect to a Participant’s Account’s deemed investment in an Investment Fund
shall not be taken into account with respect to or in valuing a Participant’s
Account following the Valuation Date for payment in accordance with Section
7.07.

  

ARTICLE VI – WITHDRAWALS AND LOANS

  

6.01 Withdrawals. A Participant shall not be entitled to withdraw any portion
of his Account while employed by any System Company.

  

6.02 Loans. A Participant shall not be eligible to obtain a loan from the
Plan.

  

ARTICLE VII – VESTING, FORFEITURES AND PAYMENTS

  

7.01 Vesting of Matching Restoration Account. Except as provided in Section
9.03, a Participant shall be fully vested at all times in the Participant’s
Matching Restoration Account.

  

  

* * *

  

7.02 Vesting of Employer Retirement Restoration Account. Cliff vesting shall
apply to the Employer Retirement Restoration Account and, except as provided
in Section 9.03, a Participant shall become fully vested in the Participant’s
Employer Retirement Restoration Account upon the earliest to occur of (a) the
date the Participant attains age 65, (b) the Participant’s completion of three
(3) years of Vesting Service, (c) the Participant’s Separation from Service by
reason of death, or (d) accelerated vesting of the Participant’s Account
pursuant to Section 9.02. Prior to the first to occur of the events set forth
in subsections 7.02(a) – (d), the Participant shall not be vested in any
portion of the Participant’s Employer Retirement Restoration Account.

  

7.03 Forfeiture of Employer Retirement Restoration Account. If a Participant
has a Separation from Service when the Participant is not vested in the
Participant’s Employer Retirement Restoration Account, the balance of the
Participant’s Employer Retirement Restoration Account shall be forfeited.

  

7.04 Payment of Account Upon Separation from Service. Except as otherwise
required by Section 7.08 or Section 9.03, upon a Participant’s Separation from
Service, the value of the vested portion of the Participant's Account shall be
paid to the Participant as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Participant’s Separation from Service, in accordance with Sections 7.06, 7.07
and, if applicable, 7.08.

  

7.05 Death. Upon a Participant’s Separation from Service due to the
Participant’s death, the value of the Participant’s Account shall be paid to
the Participant’s Beneficiary as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Participant’s death, in accordance with Sections 7.06 and 7.07.

  

7.06 Form of Payment. The vested value of a Participant's Account shall be
paid in a single lump sum by the Employer in cash, less applicable payroll and
withholding taxes.

  

7.07 Value of Account for Payment. Prior to a lump-sum payment, a
determination by the Administrator of the amount of such payment shall be made
by valuing the vested Account Balance on a Valuation Date following the
Participant’s Separation from Service selected by the Administrator in
accordance with administrative procedures adopted by the Administrator.

  

7.08 Required Six-Month Delay for Certain Payments. Notwithstanding Section
7.04, if a Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of his Separation
from Service and the vested Account becomes payable to the Participant under
this Plan by reason of the Participant’s Separation from Service, then such
payment shall not be paid to the Participant prior to the earlier of (a) the
expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of the
Participant's Separation from Service, or (b) the date of the Participant's
death. The Participant's vested Account the value of which is determined
pursuant to Section 7.07 shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable
following the earlier of the end of Participant's six-month delay period or
the Participant's death in accordance with Section 7.05.

  

7.09 Minor or Incompetent. In the event any amount becomes payable under the
provisions of the Plan to a Participant, Beneficiary or other person who is a
minor or an incompetent, whether or not declared incompetent by a court, such
amount may be paid directly to the minor or incompetent person or to such
person’s fiduciary (or attorney-in-fact in the case of an incompetent) as the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may decide,

  

* * *

  

and neither the Administrator nor any System Company shall be liable to any
other person for any such decision or any payment pursuant thereto.

  

ARTICLE VIII – SOURCE OF PAYMENTS

  

8.01 Unfunded Plan. It is a condition of the Plan that neither a Participant
nor any other person or entity shall look to any person or entity other than
the Employer for the payment of benefits under the Plan. The Participant or
any other person or entity having or claiming a right to payments hereunder
shall rely solely on the unsecured obligation of the Employer set forth
herein. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to give the Participant or any
other person or entity any right, title, interest, or claim in or to any
specific asset, fund, reserve, account or property of any kind whatsoever,
owned by the Company or any Employer or in which the Company or any Employer
may have any right, title or interest now or in the future. However, the
Participant or any other person or entity shall have the right to enforce his
or its claim against the Employer in the same manner as any other unsecured
creditor of such entity. Neither a Participant nor his Beneficiary shall have
any rights in or against any specific assets of any System Company.

  

8.02 Employer Liability. At its own discretion, a System Company employer may
purchase such insurance or annuity contracts or other types of investments as
it deems desirable in order to accumulate the necessary funds to provide for
the future benefit payments under the Plan. However, (a) a System Company
employer shall be under no obligation to fund the benefits provided under this
Plan; (b) the investment of System Company employer funds credited to a
special account established hereunder shall not be restricted in any way; and
(c) such funds may be available for any purpose the System Company may choose.
Nothing stated herein shall prohibit a System Company employer from adopting
or establishing a trust or other means as a source for paying any obligations
created hereunder; provided, however, any and all rights that any such
Participants shall have with respect to any such trust or other fund shall be
governed by the terms thereof.

  

ARTICLE IX – CHANGE IN CONTROL

  

9.01 Definitions. The following additional definitions shall apply to this
Article IX:

  

a.“Cause” means (i) the willful and continuing failure by the Participant to
substantially perform the Participant’s duties (other than such failure
resulting from the Participant’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness
or any such actual or anticipated failure after the issuance of a notice of
termination for Good Reason by the Participant), provided that any such
failure has not been cured by the Participant within thirty (30) days after a
written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant by
the Company or the Participant’s System Company employer, which demand
specifically identifies the manner in which the Company or System Company
employer or, in the case of an ML 1-4 Participant, the Board, believes that
the Participant has not substantially performed; (ii) the willful engaging by
the Participant in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to
the Company or any System Company, monetarily or otherwise; (iii) the
Participant’s indictment for, conviction of, or entrance of a plea of guilty
or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime which has or may have a material
adverse effect on the Participant’s ability to carry out the Participant’s
duties or upon the reputation of the Company or any System Company; or (iv) a
material violation by the Participant of any agreement the Participant has
with the Company or any System Company; provided that, for purposes of clauses
(a)(i) and (a)(ii) of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the
Participant’s part shall be deemed “willful” unless done, or omitted to be
done, by the Participant not in good faith and without

  

* * *

  

reasonable belief that the Participant’s act, or failure to act, was in the
best interest of the Company or the Participant’s System Company employer.

  

b.“Good Reason” means (i) a material reduction by a Participant’s System
Company employer in the Participant’s annual base salary as in effect from
time to time or (ii) the relocation of the Participant’s principal place of
employment to a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Participant’s
principal place of employment in effect from time to time, or the Company or a
System Company requiring the Participant to be based anywhere other than such
principal place of employment (or permitted relocation thereof) except for
required travel on the business to an extent substantially consistent with
reasonable business travel obligations; provided that the Participant provides
the Company with a written notice of termination for Good Reason within ninety
(90) days following the occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason and
the Company shall not have cured the circumstance giving rise to Good Reason
within thirty (30) days following such notice.

  

c.“ML 1-4 Participant” means a Participant who, as of immediately prior to the
occurrence of a Change in Control or at any time during the two-year period
immediately following the Change in Control, is reflected on the Human
Resource records of the Participant’s System Company employer as being in
System Management level 1, 2, 3 or 4.

  

9.02 Accelerated Vesting. Subject to Section 9.03 below, in the event that (a)
a Change in Control occurs and (b) a Participant’s employment or service is
terminated by the Company, its successor or an affiliate thereof without Cause
or is terminated by the Participant for Good Reason (if applicable), in each
case on or after the effective date of the Change in Control but prior to the
second anniversary of the Change in Control, then any unvested portion of such
Participant’s Account shall vest in full regardless of such Participant’s
vested status under the Savings Plan.

  

9.03 Forfeiture and/or Repayment of Benefits. Notwithstanding anything in the
Plan to the contrary, all amounts credited to a Participant’s Account in
accordance with Article V shall be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment upon
the occurrence of such Participant’s breach of the restrictive covenants
contained in any agreement between the Participant and any System Company.

  

9.04 Payment in Error. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in
the event that a payment is made to a Participant or Beneficiary in error that
exceeds the amount to which the Participant or Beneficiary is entitled
pursuant to the terms of the Plan (such excess amount, an “Excess Payment”),
the Participant or Beneficiary shall repay to the Participant’s System Company
employer, and such System Company employer shall have the right to recoup from
the Participant or the Beneficiary, such Excess Payment by notifying the
Participant or Beneficiary in writing of the nature and amount of such Excess
Payment together with (a) demand for direct repayment to the System Company
employer by the Participant or Beneficiary in the amount of such Excess
Payment or (b) reduction of any amount(s) owed to the Participant or
Beneficiary by the System Company employer or any other System Company by the
amount of the Excess Payment.

the Plan, including the intent of the Plan and any ambiguous, disputed or
doubtful provisions of the Plan. All findings, decisions, or determinations of
any type made by the Administrator, including factual determinations and any
interpretation or construction of the Plan, shall be final and binding on all
parties and shall not be disturbed unless the Administrator's decisions are
arbitrary and capricious. The Administrator shall be the sole judge of the
standard of proof required in any claim for benefits and/or in any question of
eligibility for a benefit. By way of example, the Administrator shall have the
sole and exclusive power and discretion:

  

a.to adopt such rules and regulations as it shall deem desirable or necessary
for the administration of the Plan on a consistent and uniform basis;

b.to interpret the Plan including, without limitation, the power to use the
Administrator's sole and exclusive discretion to construe and interpret (1)

doubtful provisions of the Plan;

c.to determine all questions arising in the administration of the Plan
including, but not limited to, the power and discretion to determine the

determinations based on the facts and evidence contained in the administrative
record developed during the claims review procedure.

  

For any acts not specifically enumerated above, when applying, construing, or
interpreting any and all Plan provisions and/or fact questions presented in
claims for benefits, the Administrator shall have the same discretionary
powers as enumerated above.

  

* * *

  

  

10.03 Reliance on Reports and Certificates. The Administrator may rely
conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports
furnished by an actuary, accountant, counsel or other person who may from time
to time be employed or engaged for such purposes.

  

10.04 Claims Administration. The Administrator may appoint and, in its sole
discretion, remove a Claims Administrator and/or Claims Appeal Administrator
to administer claims for benefits under the Plan in accordance with its terms,
and, pursuant to Section 10.02, such delegates shall have all powers,
authority, and discretion necessary or proper for such purpose. In the absence
of such appointment, the Administrator shall be the Claims Administrator and
Claims Appeal Administrator.

  

10.05 Filing Benefit Claims. Any claim asserting entitlement to a benefit
under the Plan must be asserted within ninety (90) days after the event giving
rise to the claim by sending written notice of the claim to the Claims
Administrator. The written notice of the claim must be accompanied by any and
all documents, materials, or other evidence allegedly supporting the claim for
benefits. If the claim is granted, the claimant will be so notified in writing
by the Claims Administrator.

  

10.06 Denial or Partial Denial of Benefit Claims. If the Claims Administrator
denies a claim for benefits in whole or part, the Claims Administrator shall
notify the claimant in writing of the decision within ninety (90) days after
the claim has been received by the Claims Administrator. In the Claim
Administrator's sole discretion, the Claims Administrator may extend the time
to decide the claim for an additional ninety (90) days, by giving written
notice of the need for such an extension any time prior to the expiration of
the initial ninety (90) day period. The Claims Administrator, in its sole
discretion, reserves the right to request specific information from the
claimant, and reserves the right to have the claimant examined or tested by
person(s) employed or compensated by the Employer. If the claim is denied or
partially denied, the Claims Administrator shall provide the claimant with
written notice stating:

  

a.the specific reasons for the denial of the claim (including the facts upon
which the denial was based) and reference to any pertinent plan provisions on
which the denial is based;

b.if applicable, a description of any additional material or information
necessary for claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary; and

c.an explanation of the claims review appeal procedure including the name and
address of the person or committee to whom any appeal should be directed.

  

10.07 Appeal of Claims That Are Denied or Partially Denied. The claimant may
request review of the Claims Administrator's denial or partial denial of a
claim for Plan benefits. Such request must be made in writing within sixty
(60) days after claimant has received notice of the Claims Administrator's
decision and shall include with the written request for an appeal any and all
documents, materials, or other evidence which claimant believes supports his
claim for benefits. The written request for an appeal, together with all
documents, materials, or other evidence which claimant believes supports his
claim for benefits should be addressed to the Claims Administrator, who will
be responsible for submitting the appeal for review to the Claims Appeal
Administrator.

  

* * *

  

  

10.08 The Appeal Process. The Claims Administrator will submit the appeal to
the Claims Appeal Administrator for review of the denial or partial denial of
the claim. Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of claimant's appeal, the
claimant will be notified of the final decision of the Claims Appeal
Administrator, unless, in the Claims Appeal Administrator's sole discretion,
circumstances require an extension of this period for up to an additional
sixty (60) days. If such an extension is required, the Claims Appeal
Administrator shall notify claimant of this extension in writing before the
expiration of the initial sixty-day period. During the appeal, the Claims
Appeal Administrator, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to request
specific information from the claimant, and reserves the right to have the
claimant examined or tested by person(s) employed or compensated by the
Employer. The final decision of the Claims Appeal Administrator shall set
forth in writing the facts and plan provisions upon which the decision is
based. All decisions of the Claims Appeal Administrator are final and binding
on all employees, Participants, their Beneficiaries, or other claimants.

  

10.09 Judicial Proceedings for Benefits. No claimant may file suit in court to
obtain benefits under the Plan without first completely exhausting all stages
of this claims review process. In any event, no legal action seeking Plan
benefits may be commenced or maintained against the Plan more than ninety (90)
days after the Claims Appeal Administrator's decision on appeal.

  

ARTICLE XI – AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

  

11.01 Termination and Amendment. The Board of Directors, the Personnel
Committee or any other person or persons whom the Personnel Committee may
expressly from time to time authorize to take any and all such actions for and
on behalf of Entergy Corporation and the respective Employers shall have the
right, in its absolute discretion and consistent with the requirements of Code
Section 409A, at any time and from time to time, to modify or amend, in whole
or in part, any or all of the provisions of this Plan, or suspend or terminate
the Plan entirely, subject to the provisions of Section 11.02 and the
requirements of Code Section 409A regarding plan terminations. Any such action
shall be evidenced by the minutes of the Board of Directors or the Personnel
Committee or a written certificate of amendment or termination executed by any
person or persons so authorized by the Personnel Committee. No amendment to,
or termination of the Plan shall reduce the amount credited to a Participant's
Account under this Plan through the date of any such amendment or termination
without the Participant’s consent.

  

11.02 Successors. An Employer shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or
substantially all of its business and/or assets to expressly assume and agree
to perform this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. Failure of the Employer to obtain such assumption and agreement prior
to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Plan,
and the Employer shall be liable for payment of all Plan benefits to which its
Employee Participants are entitled upon their Separation from Service. Any
successor or surviving entity that assumes or otherwise adopts this Plan as
contemplated in this Section 11.02 shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the Employer and the Personnel Committee hereunder, subject to the
restrictions on amendment or termination of the Plan as set forth in Section
11.01. The employment of a Participant who has

  

* * *

  

continued in the employ of such successor or surviving entity shall not be
deemed to have been terminated or severed for any purpose hereunder.

  

ARTICLE XII – MISCELLANEOUS

records of his System Company employer.

  

12.02 Gender and Number. The masculine pronoun whenever used in the Plan shall
include the feminine. Similarly, the feminine pronoun whenever used in the
Plan shall include the masculine as the context or facts may require. Whenever
any words are used herein in the singular, they shall be construed as if they
were also used in the plural in all cases where the context so applies.

  

12.03 Captions. The captions of this Plan are not part of the provisions of
the Plan and shall have no force and effect.

  

12.04 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held

affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

  

12.05 Controlling Law. The administration of the Plan, and any trust
established thereunder, shall be governed by applicable federal law, including
ERISA to the extent applicable, and to the extent federal law is inapplicable,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law
principles of any state. Any persons or corporations who now are or shall
subsequently become parties to the Plan shall be deemed to consent to this
provision.

  

12.06 No Right to Employment. The Plan confers no right upon any Employee to
continue his employment with any employer, whether or not a System Company.

delegates against any and all claims and causes of action by or on behalf of
any and all parties whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including, without

any act or omission relating to or in connection with the Plan and, if
applicable, any trust other than losses resulting from any such person's fraud
or willful misconduct.

  

12.08 No Alienation. Participants’ Account balances under this Plan, and any
rights and privileges pertaining thereto, shall not be subject to alienation,
pledge, anticipation,

  

* * *

  

attachment, garnishment, receivership, execution or levy of any kind,
including liability for alimony or support payments, and any attempt to cause
such amounts to be so subjected shall not be recognized, except to the extent
as may be required by law, including laws of descent and distribution.

  

12.09 Section 409A Compliance. It is intended that all of the payments and
benefits made or provided under the Plan are intended to comply with or be
exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder,
in either case so that none of the payments to be provided hereunder will be
subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A, and the Plan
shall at all times be interpreted consistently with such intent. If any
provision of this Plan would otherwise conﬂict with or frustrate this intent,
such provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the
conﬂict. The Administrator reserves the right to take any action it deems
appropriate or necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors of

EX-14.(A) 10 a10kex-14a2020.htm EX-14.(A)  Document

  

Exhibit 14(a)

  

ENTERGY CORPORATION

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

  

  

The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Entergy Corporation (the "Company")
has adopted the following Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code ")
for the Company’s directors, executive officers and for all employees of the
Company or any corporation, partnership, trade or business in which the
Company has a direct or indirect majority ownership interest (collectively,
“Entergy Representatives”). This Code is intended to: a) provide guidance to
help Entergy Representatives recognize and deal with ethical issues; b)
provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct; and c) help foster a culture
of honesty, accountability and mutual respect. It is expected that each
Entergy Representative will comply with the letter and spirit of this Code.

  

1.Conflicts of Interest

  

An Entergy Representative shall not allow his or her private interest to
interfere with the interests of the Company as a whole. A “conflict of
interest” occurs when an Entergy Representative takes actions or has interests
that make it difficult to perform his or her duties objectively and
effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an Entergy
Representative, or a member of his or her immediate family, receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company. Entergy
Representatives must avoid, and may not have, conflicts of interests with the
Company.

  

Any action by, or interest of, a director that creates, or may reasonably be
expected to create, a conflict of interest with the Company must be disclosed
immediately by the director to the Chair of the Corporate Governance
Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will review and analyze all such
disclosures. If the Committee believes that a conflict of interest exists, the
Committee Chair, in coordination with the Chairman of the Board, shall present
this finding to the entire Board for appropriate action.

  

If an officer or employee has any reason to believe that he or she has a
conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest, then the officer or
employee shall take the actions required in the Company’s Conflict of Interest
Policy.

  

2.Corporate Opportunities

  

Business opportunities that come to Entergy Representatives through access to
Company property or information belong to the Company. Entergy Representatives
are prohibited from: (a) taking for themselves personally opportunities that
are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or the
Covered Employee’s position; (b) using the Company's property or information,
or the Entergy Representatives position, for personal gain; or (c) competing
with the Company, directly or indirectly, for business opportunities,
provided, however, if the Company's disinterested directors determine that the
Company will not pursue an opportunity that relates to the Company's business,
an Entergy Representative may do so.

  

  

* * *

  

3.Confidentiality

  

Entergy Representatives must maintain the confidentiality of non-public
information that they acquire in carrying out their duties and
responsibilities, except where disclosure is approved by the Company or
legally mandated. Confidential information includes, without limitation, trade
secrets, nonpublic financial and operational information, customer
information, unreleased plans or forecasts, vendor and customer information,
formulas, designs and other inventions covered by a patent, copyright or
trademark, employee information and records where the possession of such
information was obtained as part of their formal duties, other corporate and
personal information and information that if, not properly safeguarded, might
impair the security or privacy of the Company’s facilities or personnel.

  

4.Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets

  

Entergy Representatives shall protect Company assets and should only use
Company property for official Company business. Entergy Representatives may
not use Company time, supplies, equipment, tools, buildings or other assets
for personal benefit without prior authorization.

  

5.Ethical Behavior and Fair Dealing

  

The Company’s reputation for ethical behavior is critical to its success.
Directors must lead by example and act with integrity and honesty to promote
an environment that encourages the Company’s officers and employees to sustain
and enhance the Company’s reputation.

  

Each Entergy Representative has a responsibility to act honestly and
transparently with the Company’s customers, suppliers and other employees, and
to treat each other, as well as the Company’s customers, suppliers and
competitors, with fairness and respect. The Company will always participate in
the marketplace fairly and lawfully and Entergy Representatives shall refuse
to participate in any conduct or practice that is intended to take unfair
advantage of anyone, including through manipulation, concealment, abuse of
privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other
unfair dealing practices.

  

6.Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations

  

Entergy Representatives shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations
applicable to the Company, including securities laws and the Company’s
policies governing trading of securities.

  

7.Special Provisions Relating to Principal Executive Officer and Senior
Financial Officers

  

The principal executive officer and senior financial officers responsible for
the preparation, evaluation and dissemination of financial information hold an
important and elevated role in corporate governance. Therefore, the Company
expects that such personnel will adhere to and advocate the following
principles and responsibilities governing professional and ethical conduct.

  

  

* * *

  

To the best of their knowledge and ability, such personnel shall:

  

•Act with honesty and integrity, ethically handling actual or apparent
conflicts of interest in personal and professional relationships.

  

•Provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and in public communications made by the Company.

  

•Comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations of federal, state,
provincial and local governments, and other appropriate private and public
regulatory agencies.

  

•Act in good faith, responsibly, with due care, competence and diligence,
without misrepresenting material facts or allowing independent judgment to be
subordinated.

  

•Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of work
except when authorized or otherwise legally obligated to disclose.
Confidential information acquired in the course of work shall not be used for
personal advantage.

  

•Share knowledge and maintain skills important and relevant to constituents’
needs.

  

•Proactively promote ethical behavior as a responsible colleague among peers
in the work environment and community.

  

8.Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

  

Any waiver of this Code for a director or an executive officer of the Company
may be made only by the Board, following a recommendation by the Corporate
Governance Committee, and must be promptly disclosed to the Company’s
shareholders.

  

9.Failure to Comply; Compliance Procedures

  

Entergy Representatives, who are employees, should read this Code in
conjunction with the Code of Entegrity and any other applicable Entergy codes
or policies. A failure by any Entergy Representative to comply with the laws
or regulations governing the Company’s business, this Code or any other
applicable Company policy or requirement may result in disciplinary action
and, if warranted, legal proceedings.

  

No code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise. Accordingly,
this Code is intended to serve as a source of guiding principles for
directors. Directors are encouraged to bring questions about particular
circumstances that may implicate one or more of the provisions of this Code to
the attention of the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, who may
consult with inside or outside legal counsel as appropriate. Directors should
communicate any suspected violations of this Code, including any unethical
behavior or violation of law or governmental rule or regulation, promptly to
the Lead Director, the Chairman or the Chair of the Corporate Governance
Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee, or a person or persons
designated by that Committee, will investigate violations and, where
necessary, make recommendations to the Board. Entergy Representatives, who are
employees, should report

  

* * *

  

any known, suspected or potential violations of any such laws or regulations
or this Code according to the procedures provided in the Company’s Code of
Entegrity and other applicable Company policies.

  

This Code does not create any employment contract or any other contractual
obligation between an employee and the Company. This Code is not intended to,
and shall not be construed to, interfere with or restrict any rights provided
by law, including those afforded under the National Labor Relations Act.
Nothing in this policy will be construed to limit an employee’s right to speak
with others regarding wages and other terms and conditions of employment or to
exercise any other legally protected right. Employees should read this Code in
conjunction with the Company's Code of Entegrity and any other applicable code
of conduct of the Company.
