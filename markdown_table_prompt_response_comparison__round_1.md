I have the following problem which I posed to 4 different LLMs. I want you to carefully read the problem and then each solution. Choose the best ideas and elements from ALL solutions to the extent they are complementary and not conflicting/inconsistent, and then weave together a true hybrid "best of all worlds" implementation which you are highly confident will not only work, but will outperform any of the individual solutions individually:

I want you to make me a super sophisticated yet performant python function called "fix_invalid_markdown_tables" that takes markdown text as input and looks for tables that are invalid, then diagnoses what is wrong with them, and fixes them in a minimally invasive way. The function should make no change at all to any tables that ARE valid, and it should skip over any non-table content completely. 

Here are examples of invalid tables it should be able to fix:

```

international customers;

Below is a single Python function, `fix_invalid_markdown_tables`, ready to paste into your code base. It scans the input Markdown line by line, identifies potential table blocks, measures how many columns each block should have, and minimally adjusts the lines (including alignment rows) so that columns match. It does nothing to lines/tables that are already valid and skips over any lines that do not appear to be part of a table.

```

Explanation of the approach:

1. We split the text into lines.  
2. We accumulate lines into a “table block” only if they contain at least one pipe (`|`). Anything else is assumed to be outside of a table.  
3. When a non-pipe line is encountered (or we reach the end), we finalize (“flush”) the current table block.  
4. While flushing, we find the maximum number of columns in the block. We then adjust each line to have that number of columns. If we detect an alignment line (only composed of `-`, `|`, `:`, and spaces), we switch its columns to `---` so it remains valid.  
5. We preserve the presence or absence of a leading pipe on the very first line of the block to keep the style consistent across the whole table.  
6. Lines that are already consistent remain practically unchanged.  

This ensures we only minimally fix invalid tables. Valid tables will pass through with no modifications, and anything not containing a `|` is ignored.

```

```

Below is my reasoning and then the full code.

### Reasoning  
Markdown tables are defined by a header row, a divider row (with dashes optionally flanked by colons for alignment), and then one or more data rows. However, many “invalid” tables occur because (a) extra divider rows are inserted between data rows, (b) rows span multiple lines (with the cell content “wrapped”), or (c) rows have an inconsistent number of columns. In the solution below I first “collect” contiguous lines that look like they belong to a table (i.e. they contain pipes or are continuations of the previous row), then merge wrapped lines into the appropriate row. Each row is split into cells (trimming extra leading/trailing pipes), and we compute the maximum column count so that all rows have a consistent number of cells. We then check whether the second row is a valid divider row (by seeing if each cell matches the typical “---” pattern). If it isn’t (or if extra divider rows appear later) we insert a single divider row immediately after the header row and remove any extra divider rows. Finally, each row is reassembled in standard “| cell1 | cell2 | … |” format. Importantly, if a table already meets the markdown standard the function leaves it completely unchanged.

### Code

```python
import re

def fix_invalid_markdown_tables(text: str) -> str:
    def is_divider_row(cells):
        pat = re.compile(r'^\s*:?-{3,}:?\s*$')
        return all(pat.match(cell) for cell in cells if cell.strip() != '')
    def merge_block(block):
        merged = []
        for line in block:
            if '|' in line:
                merged.append(line.rstrip())
            elif merged and line.strip():
                merged[-1] += ' ' + line.strip()
        return merged
    def process_table_block(block):
        merged = merge_block(block)
        rows = []
        for line in merged:
            s = line.strip()
            if s.startswith('|'): s = s[1:]
            if s.endswith('|'): s = s[:-1]
            cells = [c.strip() for c in s.split('|')]
            rows.append(cells)
        max_cols = max(len(r) for r in rows) if rows else 0

        out = []
        if fixed_rows:
            header = fixed_rows[0]
            out.append(header)

    return "\n".join(out_lines)
```

### Explanation  
– The helper function `merge_block` glues together lines that are continuations of a table row (lines without a pipe following a line that does contain one).  
– Each merged row is split by pipes (after stripping off any leading/trailing ones) and padded to the maximum column count.  
– The function then checks if a valid divider row exists as the second row; if not, it inserts one. Any extra divider rows later are omitted.  
– Finally, the rows are reassembled into a standard markdown table format and substituted back into the overall markdown text, leaving non-table content unchanged.

This function should meet the requirements by “fixing” the common issues with invalid markdown tables in a minimally invasive manner while leaving valid tables intact.

```


Grok3 with thinking:

```

Below is a sophisticated and performant Python function called fix_invalid_markdown_tables that addresses the user's requirements. This function takes markdown text as input, identifies invalid tables, diagnoses their issues, and fixes them in a minimally invasive way. It leaves valid tables and non-table content unchanged, focusing only on correcting structural problems in invalid tables.
Function Overview
The function:
Identifies tables: Detects potential table blocks as sequences of consecutive lines containing pipes (|), requiring at least three such lines to consider it a table worth fixing.
Diagnoses issues: Determines the number of columns based on the maximum number of cells in any row and checks for missing or misplaced separators.
Fixes minimally: Ensures each table has a header, a separator row with dashes (---), and content rows, adjusting cell counts by adding empty cells where needed.
Preserves valid tables: Skips tables that already conform to standard markdown table structure.
Skips non-table content: Leaves text without pipe characters or insufficient table-like structure untouched.

How It Works
Splitting the Text
The markdown text is split into lines using splitlines().
Lines are grouped into blocks separated by empty lines, preserving the original structure.
Identifying Tables
A block is considered a potential table if it has at least three lines containing pipes (|). This threshold ensures that small, ambiguous structures (like the two-line blocks in the first example) are not mistakenly treated as tables unless they meet a minimum complexity.
Fixing Invalid Tables
Cell Splitting: Each line is split into cells using split_row, which separates on | and strips whitespace. For example, | A | B | becomes ['', 'A', 'B', ''].
Column Count: The number of columns is set to the maximum number of cells across all rows in the block, ensuring all content fits.
Header: The first line is treated as the header, padded with empty cells if necessary.
Separator: A new separator row with --- for each column is inserted after the header, replacing any existing separators to enforce correct structure.
Content Rows: Remaining lines are adjusted to match the column count by adding empty cells, then reconstructed with pipes.
Preserving Valid Tables and Non-Table Content
Blocks with fewer than three pipe-containing lines are left unchanged, skipping non-table content and small structures.
Valid tables (with a header, a correctly formatted separator, and consistent column counts) are effectively preserved since the fixing process aligns with their existing structure.
Example Fixes
Example 1: Multiple Small "Tables"
Input:
| ●| we have a limited customer base and limited sales and relationships with international customers;
---|---|---
| ●| difficulty in managing multinational operations;
---|---|---
Output:
| ●| we have a limited customer base and limited sales and relationships with international customers;
---|---|---
| ●| difficulty in managing multinational operations;
---|---|---
Diagnosis: Each block has only two lines with pipes, insufficient to qualify as a table needing fixing (requires ≥3).
Action: Left unchanged, as they may be intended as list items rather than tables.
Example 2: Table with Extra Pipes and Formatting
Input:
**Title of each class**|  | **Trading**** ****Symbol**|  | **Name of each exchange on which********registered**
---|---|---|---|---
American Depositary Shares, each representing 15 Class A ordinary share| ​| CAN| ​| NASDAQ Global Market.
Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.00000005 per share*| ​| ​| ​| NASDAQ Global Market.
Output:
| **Title of each class** |  | **Trading** **Symbol** |  | **Name of each exchange on which****registered** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| American Depositary Shares, each representing 15 Class A ordinary share | ​ | CAN | ​ | NASDAQ Global Market. |
| Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.00000005 per share* | ​ | ​ | ​ | NASDAQ Global Market. |
Diagnosis: Four lines with pipes, header has five cells due to extra pipes, separator and content rows match.
Fix: Sets columns to 5 (max cells), standardizes all rows to five cells, places separator after header.
Example 3: Large Financial Table
Input:
|  | July 31,|  |  | October 31,|
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
|  | 2023|  |  | 2022|
|  | (unaudited)|  |  |  |
ASSETS|  |  |  |  |  |
Current assets:|  |  |  |  |  |
Cash and cash equivalents|  | $| 1,506,028|  |  | $| 73,648|
[... more lines ...]
Output:
|  | July 31, |  |  | October 31, |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |  |
|  | (unaudited) |  |  |  |  |
| ASSETS |  |  |  |  |  |
| Current assets: |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cash and cash equivalents |  | $ | 1,506,028 |  | $ | 73,648 |
[... adjusted subsequent lines ...]
Diagnosis: Multiple lines with pipes (more than 3), header has six cells, other rows vary in cell count.
Fix: Sets columns to 6, pads all rows to six cells with empty cells where needed, places separator after the first line.
Why This Solution?
Sophistication: Handles varied invalid table structures by dynamically determining column counts and enforcing standard markdown format.
Performance: Uses efficient string splitting and list operations, minimizing regex for simplicity and speed.
Minimal Invasion: Only adjusts cell counts and adds a separator, preserving original content and formatting within cells.
Correctness: Ensures tables have a header, separator, and content rows with consistent column numbers, adhering to markdown standards.
This function effectively meets the user's needs by fixing the provided examples while respecting valid tables and non-table content.

```


Claude3.7 with thinking:

```
I've created a Python function that fixes invalid markdown tables while preserving valid ones and leaving non-table content untouched. The function handles several types of markdown table issues I identified in your examples:

1. Tables with repeated separator rows after each data row
2. Tables with inconsistent column counts across rows
3. Tables with multi-line content within cells
4. Tables with alignment and structure issues

The implementation uses a step-by-step approach:

1. First, it splits the input markdown into blocks (potential tables and other content)
2. For each block that might be a table (contains pipes and separator rows), it:
   - Analyzes the table structure to identify headers and separator rows
   - Checks if the table has repeated separators or inconsistent column counts
   - Normalizes columns to ensure consistency
   - Handles complex cases with multi-line content within cells

For example, when processing a table with repeated separators after each row (like your first example), it will remove unnecessary separator rows and maintain just one separator row after the header.

The function is designed to be minimally invasive - it only modifies what's necessary to make tables valid while preserving the original content and structure as much as possible.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
